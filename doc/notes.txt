Some thoughts on how things must work in the universe:

Relationship between numbers and geometric shapes

Numbers:              Geometrical shape
1 ^ 1 = 1             point
1 squared is 1        point
1 cubed is 1          point
1^4 is 1              point
1^5 is 1              point
...etc.


All are points in all 5 dimensions.  The number one represents unity (in the spirtual evolutionary sense as well).

Numbers:              Geometrical shape
2 ^ 1                 line
2 squared is 4        square (2-d)
2 cubed is 8          cube (3-d)
2^4 is 16             cube in 4d
2^5 is 32             ...
etc.

The number two represents duality (in the spiritual evolutionary sense as well).  Music is harmonious to us because we are in duality.  This is why dividing a string in half produces the same note an octave higher, and dividing it by 3 produces a perfect fifth.  This point is important as we take into account the tones in music (different tuning temperments, their ratios, and why) and how that should be applied to the markets, from a pure numerical perspective, and then a planetary trendline perspective, which is just the same thing but adapting the phenomena to space-time distortions.


Numbers:              Geometrical shape
3 ^ 1 = 3             
3 ^ 2 = 9             triangle
3 ^ 3 = 27            triangular pyramid
3 ^ 4 = 81            ...
3 ^ 5 = 243            ...
3 ^ 6 = 729            ...
3 ^ 7 = 2187            ...

Numbers:              Geometrical shape
9 squared is 81       ?
9 cubed is 729        ?
9 ^4 is 6561          ?
9 ^5 is 59049          ?

9 is a special number:
If you add the digits of the squared number, they sum up to 9, which was the original root number.  So there is a DIFFERENT KIND OF RELATIONSHIP (exponent to exponent or square to square) going on here.  

Hence, 3 is much more tightly coupled to 9, 81, and 729 than 27, 243, 2187.


In the above, 2 ^ 2 is 2 times 2, and the reproduction produced 4, a different quality.  If you keep incrementing the exponent, the result can be deduced to one of: 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8.  It can not reproduce a number that reduces to a 3 or a 9.  Hence, in reproduction, a 2 yields a reduced 2 every so often (in a pattern).  We should note that 2 ^ x (x incrementing) does produce 3's and 9's in the results at different place digits.  How does this factor into the reproduction of child/derivative numbers?


The above exercise should all be done again for numbers in different radixes.  How does this influence what they get reduced to?


Special numbers:
pi, phi, square roots because squaring them comes to a whole numbers, same with cube-roots, etc.  What are the geometric shapes for these numbers, and then also, what are the geometric shape relationships between the original shape and the ones with one less dimension and one more dimension?



Application:
Trading entities are 'born' in a certain dimension (as are humans).  They have components of each number that make it up, and hence they each have to some degree influences from each geometric shape.  

As noted in the Cowan books, these are actually trying to transcend the current dimension and move to the next.  They try to build the next dimensional object.  There are various ways this is done, depending on the dimension being looked at.  For example, if you have a square and you are trying to build a cube, it is filling up the volume of the cube with something.  The mass contained within teh cube as the cube is being built is not uniform in weight distribution.  So if we know the structure and method at which the square gets built into a cube, we can fractically extrapolate what the end volume and weight will be!  This concept and idea is is how I believe Gann was able to say that a certain trading entity will go to a certain price by a certain time.  

All these ideas in number or geometric shape/solid have their equivalent representation in planetary position, as they are all the same.  So when there are posts by Alblak about translating planetary position to price and back, he is basically doing it for the dominant planet(s), and thus also the dominate geometric shapes/solids that apply to that trading entity.

So at the current moment, I think that the planets in our solar system are just a representation that is equivalent to several different geometric X-dimensional shapes/solids centered at the Sun.  As these shapes/solids build and assemble itself it is what may be the 'tunnel through the air'.   What I should do is calculate the rate of expansion of planetary orbital radiuses, then see how that comes out relative to the mass of the planets/objects in the universe.  Then compare these numbers to the speed at which 'space' is expanding.  In Indian vedic literature, akasa is the space/ether element, and it may have some connection to amritha/soma and other such necters churned from the gods.


Other thoughts:

There must be some special relationship between pi and our universe.  Many of the movements and 3d objects in the universe are spherical.  How and why is this the case???  What is the connection here.  This is a key missing piece.

Could wolf frequencies or pythagorean coma be the phenomena that causes the planets to revolve around the sun, and the sun to revolve around the galactic center?  These MUST play some role in how everything comes together...

How to connect this all with the arrangement of the periodic table and the atomic composition of the elements?

Thoughts I had while waking up this morning.

Scientists and physicists today are trying to make the connection between the Quantum relativistic world and the macro world.  There must be a unifying theory between the two.

When waking up this morning, I had a realization that two points in time must have a gravitational pull towards each other, even though they are massless.  So what this implies is that the equation:

F=G([m1*m2]/D^2)

F is the force of gravity being calculated in Newtons
G is the Gravitational Constant of 6.673E-11 Newtons.
The Ms are the masses of the objects in question.
D is the distance between the centers of the objects.

is just missing a time factor!!!

Is there a time squarted variable in the denominator?    I liken this extension of gravity to the way that the PTV vector is used in price behavior of the markets.



Also, for gravitation pull and effects of astrology (from the the birth moment) there must be a distinction between things with no mass and things with mass.  

Things with no mass are: price behavior of financial markets, ideas, thoughts, and questions asked in prashna.

Massive objects include: humans, planets, cars, cities, etc.


So the factors to consider are:

Space, Time, Matter, Motion? and Energy(light/heat?).

I think Energy is translated to various forms of the above in different ratios according to certain fundamental equations such that there is no loss of energy.


Also, the modified equation for gravity should probably have the representative breakdown utilizing:
- atomic makeup
or 
- makeup according to the 5 elements as defined by the Indians (Agni, Prithvi, Jala, Vaayu, Aakasha)


How does fire exhibit its qualities here in the equations?  Is there something here as to why Gann excludes Mars in his COE/MOF?  There is probably something there to the general 'make-up' of an entity (e.g, humans with water and the moon).  

Also, theoretically, in the same way that it is possible to extract profit from the markets due to knowing the behavior of the energy in it, it should be possible to extract energy from the universe by knowing the behavior of the energy in it as well.

Add rulers for octaves in time (diatonic points):

  Just standard Do-Do sequencing in time.. fractaled octaves are shown if you will..

   DO – 2
   Ti – 1.875
   La – 1.666
   Sol – 1.5
   Fa – 1.333
   Mi - .25
   Re – 1.125
   Do - 1

    Best wishes..
     Tony 

Also, what about octaves in price (per the Gann sq-of-9 and other number charts)?  And what about octaves per the combination of price and time squared?  What I mean by this is trying to figure out octaves in PTV (price-time-vectors).


Also, I need to look at geometric mean, and geometric averages in relation to this as well.


The numbers/ratios of an octave... are they related to the vimsottari dasa sceme in any way?  E.g. Sun + moon dasa length is  6 + 10 = 16, 16 / 120 is 0.13333, matches 'Fa'.  Venus dasa length is 20, 20 / 120 = 0.1666, which is 'La'.  How does this match up with reversal of dasa with the nodes?  Also, what 'note' (planet) we start on in the vimsottari dasa sceme should be important too, to indicate what scale mode the person is running (phrygian, etc.).

What then to make up of conditional dasa schemes?

The arudhas must then vibrate at a certain frequency level too, in order to get activated by new dasas that a person go into.

Kit kat (Alain) says on WITS:
"this is based on price cycles
time cycles
and  geometry"

"well , i think ive found what gann refered to as the master of time,
the beautiful thing in it  is that you need  first to find out   your  philosophical belief of what moves the chart,
then  i must say the way to catch it, is very artistic, it comes out of exact science, but youd  see it on the chart  as  broken reality, theres  no other way to put it  together.
"

##############################################################################

My view:


In a trading entity price chart:

The source is 0 or unity.
When things leave unity, there is diffraction... which is what causes the Gann lines.
'Music' is another name/manifestation of diffraction.
What is diffraction in terms of numbers?  (Numeric dimension?)  Is this numerology.

We need to think about how reproduction happens.  Asexual vs. sexual.  The price chart is probably asexual reproduction.  Was there anything else that Bayer saw?  Reproduction is our mana putras constantly creating our own world... so in a chart there are constantly new 'births' (mayor turning points) that feed the chart in a feedback loop.  How does death happen (and calculated).  What does it mean in the price chart, for both the real birth time/price, and for the subsequent mana putras that get born as the chart is still going?

What happens on the 'other side' as we sleep?  Why is sleep 8 hours of the day or 1/3 of the day?  We are awake 2rds of the day.  How is this related to vimsottari dasa (120 years) out of 360?  We are awake 16 hours of the day on average, so 16/24 = 2/3, which would imply a Vimsottari dasa of 240 years instead of 120.  Why is this?  Is it based off of the duality principle/law?  (think AK and DK, MK and PiK).

Time is an illusion, as the start/birth point exists really in multiple points in time.  That is why we draw the Gann lines from 0.  The 0 lines are the diffraction from the source.  We also need to draw the diffraction (gann) lines from earlier points in time as well, before birth.  

Broken reality that kit kat talks about is likely the effect of the narayana dasa.  Movement... so broken in a fractal way.  Did Bayer see these dasas in a different way?

We need to think about where we are in the universe and how it differs from expected 'perfection' of manifestation.  This goes to see what the basis or mathematical deravation of Vimsottari dasa and the other dasas are.  Is Vimsottari dasa based off of this same refraction?  360 being the 'whole'?  (of which 120 out of 360 years forms)... Or is it a bigger number and we are just working the part of it within it?  

How do we fit tithis, karanas, varas, etc.  into all of this?  These must be fractal as well (and/or have diffraction) and interweve with all the other concepts/methods.

Why is the Rasi so important?  
  12 dimensions of the sun?  Upon what does this get derived?

Why is navamsa so important?  
  2^2 --> 4
  3^3 --> 9

  It is duality with those two numbers.

Why is shashyamsa so important?  
  Think about this.

What is the basis behind dig bala?  What is up with the PDFs I downloaded that talk about the false sun location?  I think Walter Russell talks about this too.  This is related, but why is reality in this situation important?  Why are the dig bala locations of planets all in kendras, and what is the significance of being in dig bala in a certain North, South, East, West, etc.  

How do the shapes and lines get traced as per Nassim Haramein?  Gann says that the markets are like building a house.  This is highlighting the fractal nature upon which the markets are being built.  The torus is key and an important part.  Is the rotating Cube really rotating?  Maybe not and maybe it is just the perception of it while we move in time... of which time is non-linear.

Things to think about are how the Nakshatras play into this.  Nakshatras being 3^3 as well as 9^2, so it exists both in the realm of duality and 3-ality.  What does it mean when there is parivartana in the Nakshatras?  What does it mean when there is parivartana in the Rasi?  We need to make sure we understand how it works with the kalachakra (prana flow).  

What is Gann's talk about mass, pressure, and temperature?  What are these attributes in a chart?  Compared to a human, mass of our body forms from our energy body.  Think more on this...




3 topics to elaborate on/think about:

1) The Gann number charts (sq-of-9, hexagon number chart, etc.)  probably are used as per the different parts of the 3-d/4-d Geometric figures (Tetrahedron, Octahedron, etc., from The Haramein video), as the growth/decay pattern is playing itself out.

2) Vimsottari Dasa (and other dasas) in Vedic astrology are probably not of the whole full spectrum (musical ratios/octaves), but maybe working out a fractal part of the whole spectrum.  This is why they say Vimsottari works best and is most versatile in Kali Yuga.  What about Rasi dasas?  Are they playing out in a similar way or are they playing out per the whole spectrum range?  

2) Diffraction is what happens when all things of manifestation move from unity to duality.  This is what causes music in pythagorean ratios.  This happens in all dimensions (physical, time, etc.).  

Double and single slit experiment: and how it is related to arudhas of houses and planets, both exact, and by degree.  What about other points like the midheaven, and their bases on which astrological houses are created.  This is probably why the house systems are split into 3's where the decendant and midheaven cross.  

How this relates to chemistry (in terms of full spectrum, and the slit from which things get diffracted when leaving the source/unity)?  What are the 'slits' in our physical universe/galaxy?  What about the precession of the equinoxes as a slit point?  

Huang Po's Tranmission of Mind, from page X.  Our greatness and unity comes from tapping and being one with that original one source that is common to all things.  I was realizing while reading this that all our sense organs rely on mutual exchange of similar sense-type to detect that physical phenomena.  For example, to determine something's texture, we have to touch it... and in touching it it is also touching us.  What we touch with (our hand/finger) also pressed on something else and touches something else (our muscle/tissue in the hand), which touches something else, and on and on through which there may be conversions to other types of manifest vibration.  Another example is sight... when we see a color with our eyes, at the same time, the eyes are reflecting a color back as well, so in reality light is being reflected around and our senses are not truly independent to be able to adequately/properly measure reality.

- Geometry: Explore the relationship of numbers in the Geometric solids.  Not only between square and sphere as is done in all the books, but also the archimedies solids.  How do these solids warp or transform to others between them all?  Are there combinations between 3 shapes for solids (Archimedies solids only utilize 2 shapes).

Based on my understanding of how Vimsottari dasa gets affected by Rahu and Ketu (conjoining the maha dasa lord in the same rasi reverses the antar dasa order), this is very similar to musical modal scales.

Also, the 'shifting' of cycles that people on WITS talk about is likely due to rasi dasas (like Narayana) or something similar that cause the chart to jump around.

Bayer talks about 'reflex' points, which act like the planet itself.  Here I think he is talking about arudhas.  So explore this with both graha arudhas and rasi arudhas.  

Study nakshatra aspects and nakshatra graha aspects.

Also study magic squares.  The first price that a trading entity logs is likely important, and so is the movement immediately after that first price.  But how does this fit in with magic squares?  How to match up that first open price with the astrology chart?  

I believe that the varga (rasi) chakras may just be magic squares.
Same with the nakshatra chakra and the kalachakra.  The greeks were obsessed with number and were knowledgeable enough about astrology and numbers to know about nakshatras in astrology, and its' mapping to greek letters and numerology for naming people.  So this knowledge of magic squares was with the Greeks.  Also, in Chinese philosophy, in I Ching and Chinese astrology, the 8 directions are given huge importance and 8 is an auspicious number.  Their I Ching and Chinese astrology are all based on magic squares and numbers.  It is said that even fung shui is based on these as well.  How can Indian thought in the field of the occult not be based on it?  Is this the geometry that the Risis were trying to highlight when writing out the Vedas?  I know that the letters in Sanskrit correspond to numbers, so are their hymns and mantras just magic square numbers recited to become actually living and manifest?

Thinking more on the topic of Vedic Geometry, and the whole Vedas and the gods i
n the Vedas as numerical and geometric constructs, it is possible that what the Vedas are describing are different configurations of magic squares/cubes.  This realization came after seeing some writing behind the 'Siva Purana (retold)' about 14000 Indas making a Brahma.  This is along the lines of what S.K. Kapoor talks about in his Vedic Mathematics and Vedic Geometry books.


In one of the WITS emails, Lorin talks about the Gann 'moving averages' and how they have a particular look-period amount.  I think the moving averages here is referring to planetary longitude averages like the MOF and the COE.  What is the look-back period that he is referring to?  I starred the email that Lorin sent referring to this.  It seemed he didn't want to speak more about the topic.  My speculation is that the lookback period is based on amount of time or price or distance of previous market legs... or perhaps it is related to rasi or nakshatra or other types of dasas.

I've been reading more about magic squares, magic cubes, magic circles
and magic stars.  Apparently they extend to additional multiple
dimensions as well.  I think this is what Gann was speaking of when he
said that markets are constructed just like building a house.  First
you construct the foundation, then you build the walls, and finally
you construct the ceiling.  


So a each leg in a bull run in the market is the construction of
smaller squares or cubes that build a larger cube that makes up the
bull run.

Something interesting is that in Indian religion/philosophy, there is
a magic triangle for durga.  Apparently there is also one for ganesh
that is a 3x3 magic square.  I think all the yantras are constructions
of these numerical magic geometric constructs.  The mantra is probably
invoking the numbers and the constructs that are on the yantra.  Is
there an optimal distance to view the yantra from?  Optimal pitch(es)
to chant the mantra, optimal breath (amount and interval) and at an
optimal volume?  And are we supposed to change our focus on various
points on the yantra based on where we are in the mantra corresponding
to the number?  These are mysteries that may yield answers upon longer
reflection and research.  

So the current conclusion I have is that ALL yantras are magic
mathematical geometric figures, and they are associated with their
diety, and those have a relationship to number and structure as well,
based on how many eyes, heads, arms, and where there is scripture
written about them in the Vedas.

Are dasas in jyotish just these magic squares/cubes/spheres being
built and transformed?  (either rotated, or inverted, etc.)

Something to look at more closely is the 27x27 magic square.  Is this
related to Jyotish?  27 is the number of Nakshatras, and if you look
at it, the 9x9 subsquare may be related to the number of padas in a
Rasi, and the edge of the 27x27 square, if counting by 9's make up 12
faces, which may coorespond to a Rasi (sun sign).

Also, think more about how these could possibly be related to the
sq-of-9 and hexagon number chart and other number charts that Gann
used.

Structure of our chakras as a secret key to understanding the numerical magic geometry related to it.  Number of chakras (back and front-ness), and petals in each... and what each means and the color and function related to each.

Planetary maturity periods as part of magic number cubes or magic number stars.

What about the sapta rishis?  What are they and why are the orion stars so important to it?  Distance?  Brightness?  And then how does this relate back to numbers for prediction?


http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chakra#Description

Study Freedom's pdf on Mantras that Gail Francisco has sent me.

In addition to the Vedic Geometry book, think about the number of incarnations of each of the trimurthi gods (Brahma, Vishnu, Shiva).  How do these relate to Geometry?

Brahma:
From wikipedia:

He is clad in red clothes. Brahma is traditionally depicted with four heads, four faces, and four arms. With each head, He continually recites one of the four Vedas. He is often depicted with a white beard (especially in North India), indicating the nearly eternal nature of his existence. Unlike most other Hindu gods, Brahma holds no weapons. One of his hands holds a scepter. Another of his hands holds a bow. Brahma also holds a string of prayer beads called the 'akshamālā' (literally "garland of eyes"), which He uses to keep track of the Universe's time. He is also shown holding the Vedas.

How does brahma years relate to human years?

It is said Brahma has no avatar.



Shiva:

http://www.religionfacts.com/hinduism/deities/shiva.htm

From wikipedia:
Shiva wears a deer in the left upper hand. He has a Trident in the right lower arm, with a crescent moon on his head. He is said to be fair like camphor or like an ice clad mountain. He has fire and Damaru and Malu or a kind of weapon. He wears five serpents as ornaments. He wears a garland of skulls. He is pressing with His feet the demon Muyalaka, a dwarf holding a cobra. He faces south. Panchakshara itself is His body.

Crescent moon: Shiva bears on his head the crescent moon.  This is the relationship between Soma and Rudra in the Rig Veda.

Shiva's particular weapon is the trident.  His Trisul that is held in His right hand represents the three Gunas—Sattva, Rajas and Tamas. That is the emblem of sovereignty. He rules the world through these three Gunas. The Damaru in His left hand represents the Sabda Brahman. It represents OM from which all languages are formed. It is He who formed the Sanskrit language out of the Damaru (drum shaped like an hourglass) sound.


Shiva's relation to time:
Another of Shiva's fearsome forms is as Kāla (Sanskrit: काल), "time", and as Mahākāla (Sanskrit: महाकाल), "great time", which ultimately destroys all things.[115][116][117] Bhairava (Sanskrit: भैरव), "terrible" or "frightful",[118] is a fierce form associated with annihilation.[119] 

The depiction of Shiva as Nataraja (Tamil: நடராஜா, Telugu: నటరాజు, Sanskrit: naṭarāja, "Lord of Dance") is popular.  In addition to the specific iconographic form known as Nataraja, various other types of dancing forms (Sanskrit: nṛtyamūrti) are found in all parts of India, with many well-defined varieties in Tamil Nadu in particular.[138] The two most common forms of the dance are the Tandava, which later came to denote the powerful and masculine dance as Kala-Mahakala associated with the destruction of the world. When it requires the world or universe to be destroyed, Lord Śiva does it by the tāṇḍavanṛtya.[139][140] and Lasya, which is graceful and delicate and expresses emotions on a gentle level and is considered the feminine dance attributed to the goddess Parvati.[141][142] Lasya is regarded as the female counterpart of Tandava.[142] The Tandava-Lasya dances are associated with the destruction-creation of the world.


Five is a sacred number for Shiva.[168] One of his most important mantras has five syllables (namaḥ śivāya).[169]

Shiva's body is said to consist of five mantras, called the pañcabrahmans.[170] As forms of God, each of these have their own names and distinct iconography:[171]

    * Sadyojāta
    * Vāmadeva
    * Aghora
    * Tatpuruṣha
    * Īsāna

These are represented as the five faces of Shiva and are associated in various texts with the five elements, the five senses, the five organs of perception, and the five organs of action.

According to the Pañcabrahma Upanishad:

    One should know all things of the phenomenal world as of a fivefold character, for the reason that the eternal verity of Śiva is of the character of the fivefold Brahman. (Pañcabrahma Upanishad 31)

Shiva also is viewed as a manifestation of Vishnu in the Bhagavata Purana.

In Shaivite myths, on the other hand, Shiva comes to the fore and acts independently and alone to create, preserve, and destroy the world.[182] In one Shaivite myth of the origin of the lingam, both Vishnu and Brahmā are revealed as emanations from Shiva's manifestation as a towering pillar of flame.


Manifestation of Shiva in the 5 elemental substances:
Deity 	Manifestation 	Temple 	Location 	State
Jambhukeswar 	Water 	Jambukeswarar Temple, Thiruvanaikaval 	Trichy 	Tamil Nadu
Arunachaleswar 	Fire 	Annamalaiyar Temple 	Thiruvannamalai 	Tamil Nadu
Kalahastheeswara 	Air 	Srikalahasti temple 	Srikalahasti 	Andhra Pradesh
Ekambareswar 	Earth 	Ekambareswarar Temple 	Kanchipuram 	Tamil Nadu
Nataraja 	Sky 	Natarajar Temple 	Chidambaram 	Tamil Nadu



Although Puranic scriptures contain occasional references to avatars of Shiva, the idea is not universally accepted in Saivism.[5][39] The Linga Purana speaks of twenty-eight avatars of Shiva.


What is the relationship with 11 Rudras and Shiva?



there are many avtars of shiva. however main are:
HANUMAN
ADI SANKARACHARYA
SARBHA
SHUKDEV
GANESHA
JYOTIRLINGA OR(LINGA)
RUDRA
ARDHANARINATRAJ
ASWATTHAMA
all these with many others are there in shiv puran. for details you may visit: http://urday.in/shatru.htm for stories of avtars or http://urday.in/koti.htm to know about shivlingas.

Site saying (and referring to Sanskrit literature) that there are no Shiva avatars:
http://www.shaivam.org/siddhanta/tht10r.html
http://www.shaivam.org/siddhanta/tht10.html


As far as I studied and listened through Many puranas and Hymns I found Shiva had many Forms or avatars of which i mention a few i know..
..Also Shakti or parvati took avatars with him to accompany him as she did it always (except Hanuman avatar which is still in doubt of being a shiva avatar or not)
Om Namah: Shivaye
Shiv ~ Parvati
1. Hanuman Ji ~ !!
2. Tarkeshwar Nath ~ Tara Maa
3. Bhairav ~ Bhairavi
4. Shodash ~ Shodashi
5. Bhuvaneshwar ~ Bhuvaneshwari
6. Chinnmastak ~ Chinnmasta
7. Mahakaal ~ Mahakaali



Shiva is said to have special bond with Vishnu. These two Gods in Hindu Trinity are worshipped as Hari-Har, where Hari is Vishnu and Har is Shiva.


From blog : http://avatarpath.blogspot.com/2010/01/11-rudra-avatars-of-siva-their-consorts.html
Shiva has several names and avataras and various scriptures and religious books give different names. The 11 Rudras worshipped in Ekadasa Rudrabhishekam Pooja are:
1. Mahadeva, 2. Shiva , 3. Maha Rudra, 4. Shankara, 5. Neelalohita, 6. Eshana Rudra, 7. Vijaya Rudra, 8. Bheema Rudra, 9. Devadeva, 10. Bhavodbhava and 11. Adityatmaka Srirudra. 

Their 11 consorts of these 11 Rudras are:- 1. Dhee devi, 2. Dhritti devi, 3. Ushna (Rasala) devi, 4. Uma devi, 5. Neeyut devi, 5. Sarpi devi, 7. Eela devi, 8. Ambika devi, 9. Ieravati devi, 10. Sudha devi and 11. Deeksha devi respectively. 



Vishnu:

Info at this link:
http://www.religionfacts.com/hinduism/deities/vishnu.htm

Vishnu, whose name means "All-Pervading," is the protector of the world and the restorer of moral order (dharma). He is peaceful, merciful, and compassionate. 

- Four arms, each hand holding one of conch, discus, club, and lotus.  (Do each of these items represent a number set?)  Vishnu is usually depicted with four arms, though sometimes he may even have more than this number. The many arms of Hindu deities are symbolic of the god's manifold powers. 

Vishnu has 10 incarnations:
   1. Matsya (fish)
   2. Kurma (turtle)
   3. Varaha (boar)
   4. Narasimha (man-lion)
   5. Vamana (dwarf)
   6. Parashurama (warrior-priest)
   7. Rama (prince)
   8. Krishna (cow-herd)
   9. Buddha (sage)
  10. Kalki (horseman, who has not yet appeared)


Sectarian groups each presented their own preferred deity as supreme. Vishnu in his myths "becomes" Shiva.[179] The Vishnu Purana (4th c. AD) shows Vishnu awakening and becoming both Brahmā to create the world and Shiva to destroy it.[180]

Some things to think more about:

At the Natural Living Expo last weekend Dwight and Grace had an
exhibit and workshop/presentation.  During it, two concepts were
mentioned by Dwight in passing.  These may have some major
ramifications to understanding the universe we live in.

First idea is that Dwight said he can only see 100,000 past lives
back.  He says there is just nothing more?  I need to get with him and
clarify exactly what he seees here.  Is it that he can see that each
person/soul has fewer than 100,000 lives?  Or is it that he can only see
100,000 for every person/soul?

100,000 came out as a very interesting number because this is a 'lakh'
in the Indian languages which is a base unit of count in their number
system.  It is connected to mantra sastra where the mantra is recited
a certain number of times.  This is particularly interesting because I
only recently realized that they are treating the mantra as actually
being an entity that is ALIVE.  The 'siddha' (expertise or mystic
power) of the mantra only happens after a certain number of
recitations of the mantra (Num of syllables multiplied by a lakh).  

Note: A 'crore' is 10 million, or 100 lakhs.

To me, this appears to be describing each recitation as a whole
'lifetime' for the mantra, and thus analogous to human lives.  Does
that mean we get 'perfection' (i.e. spiritual enlightenment) with this
many lifetimes?  What does this imply about the market behavior and
the rebirth of trading entities on various market exchanges?

Todo: Check up the numbers of things to do for each of the ten mantra
samskara (mantra rituals) to understand the numerical structure of
what they are really doing better.

Also interesting to note is that the Tibetans also believe that they
should do 100,000 postrations (for religious purposes) in their
lifetime.

This leads to the next idea... what is really a 'lifetime' of a human?
In the markets, from studying Cowan's books and analyzing PTVs, I am
seeing that the magnitude of PTVs following musical ratios with each
other, in sequence.  Could a human 'lifetime' simply be a certain
cycle containing within it various PTV vectors?  Or is a human
lifetime just a single vector itself (with it's unique structure
related to the vectors around it, kind of like the structure of a
scale within a scale).

Since I've now started to study the markets (I've started with
Soybeans first), when I study the birth time of Soybeans (Oct 5, 1936
9:30am CST, Chicago), ... peculiarly the Jyotish techniques don't
really work that well.  For CBOT Soybeans, I tried Vimsottari dasa
from Moon, Vimsottari dasa from lagna, 100-year vimsottari dasa from
Moon, Shodasottari dasa, Ashottari dasa, and Narayana dasa.

I need to study several more trading-entity birth charts to draw any
major conclusions, but is the reason because Soybeans has such a long
history of being traded on many exchanges throughout the ages
(millenium, etc.) as 'lifetimes'/reincarnation?  Or is it because
humans have a fundamentally different energy structure compared to the
trading entities?  Perhaps what we need to understand is possible
impacts of the birth time of the human species for the derivation of
the Jyotish dasas.

One day when I have more time and understand point I would like to get
with Dwight to utilize his third-eye abilities to look back into time
of a certain soul so that I can get a string of the birth times and
death times of that certain soul, and possibly very brief info about
the life of that person for each lifetime.  Since he can see back
100,000 lives, we should be able to see a pattern emerge from the
series of birth times and death times.  This should give us a clue if
we are all just in a 'process', and how long that process is, and what
the structure of that process is.  Some things along these lines that
I think about is remembering some sayings in the Buddhist texts about
how particular enlightened sages were able to see how many lives a
person had left until enlightenment.  This is probably using a higher
facility to see this, but hints that there definitely is structure.
The same way that tibetan lamas are able to tell people at the end of
their lives where and when they will be reborn again.  This again
hints at the obvious structure.  And from Jyotish we know that the
death time can be determined from the birth time.  This links all the
lifetimes of a soul into a definite series.

Thinking more about the structure of the universe and how the puranas
talk about various dieties being made up of others, I think that maybe
they were describing how universe-structures related to various
directions of the Kalachakra relate to each other.  (14000 Indras
making a Brahma).  I am thinking the way they are talking about it is
kind of like how we might say that "Two 'So's make up a 'Do' in music
((1/2) + (1/2) = 1).  Or maybe some similarly worded thing.

Something I may want to study more deeply at some point (related to
the Kalchakra) is the chart/figure in Vedic Remedies in Astrology by
Sanjay Rath, on page 63.  That has very many indications displayed
related to the various directions.  Also I should look into the
structure of the various dasas related to the kalachakra.


Also, I wanted to mention that I am studying on the side, magic number
squares as used in Japanese and Chinese cultures in relation to time
cycles and energy spaces (locations related to the various compass
directions).  They show up in I Ching and Feng Shui (particularly 9
Start Ki).  There has got to be some significance to the differences
in the order of elements/structure 'before creation' and the order
'after creation'.  The Indian system and the kalachakra don't say
anything about there being a difference.

One thing to note is that the 9 different magic squares in the book
'Feng Shui Astrology: Using 9 Star Ki to Achieve Harmony & Happiness
In Your Life' by Jon Sandifer, I noticed that the 9 Magic squares a
very similar to the 9 magic squares used by the Hindus for the
navagrahas.  The only difference is in the Feng Shui book, they have
the number squares reduced.  I will comment more on it with time, but
another point I want to note here in case I forget later is that Eric
Parris, on our hike was telling me about how in studying or reading
Falun Gong over the years he was talking about what he heard the
Swastika is... and how it actually sequentially rotates 9 times in
each direction (clockwise and counterclockwise).  I thought this an
interesting comment, and something I may want to explore later.

---

Another thing I wanted to note that was interesting is that at the
Natural Living Expo, Dwight mentioned something about one of the
techniques he uses to put a necessary color for healing into a certain
chakra.  He said something about how he needed to put a certain color
in the 3rd chakra, but that color doesn't correspond to the chakra's
natural color and so the chakra would reject it.  He said what he
would do is put the color cooresponding to the chakra first, then
follow that color with another color, and then finally put the color
he wanted in.  This he said worked.  What in my mind I realized is
that he is probably putting in the color (frequency), and then
modulating the colors just like in music one would modulate the key of
the music from one key to the next until you get to the key you want
to be in... by using musical 7th chords.

Similarly Dwight once mentioned about how the different dimensions he
could see with the third eye have locality.  So certain dimensions are
only accessible through other dimensions.  This is a similar idea of
needed to modulate the key in a certain sequence and order to get to
the destination frequency/key.  

What are the implications of these ideas in terms of market activity
and in terms of soul-level evolution?

So I have been reading more about Feng Shui lately, specifically
Creating Sacred Space with Feng Shui.  I didn't realize that the
octagon-shaped figure that we see from I Ching was called the 'Ba
Gua', and is also used in Feng Shui.  That figure is worth studying
carefully, as there is a lot of power available to one who has full
knowledge of its significations.  If we look at all the cures related
to Feng Shui, the common denominator behind all them is that they are
trying to cause more light (and certain color(s) of light) to move in
a certain direction.  Here DIRECTIONS are what is key.  In the I
Ching, there are only 8 directions.  In Jyotish, there are 10
directions... they include both the upwards and downwards directions.

If we look at the Kalachakra, this will tell us the rulership of all
the different cycles of the panchanga, as well as their direction and
their diety rulership.  The light conversions between the different
directions are what is given in the vedic puranic texts like the Siva
Purana!  So what does it mean when a certain planet is a certain place
in the kala chakra (or rasi chart, which has compass directions too)?
Or what does it mean when a certain yoga of planets are at a certain
place?  And by that I mean yogas like Durga yoga, Yama yoga... since
these are labels in the kalachakra.  

So following up on my comment previously about the Swastika
rotating/spinning 9 times in each direction, I may need to look at the
kalachakra and how the panchanga (in time) patterns over the
kalachakra and the directions.  

So how to utilize this knowledge?  If there is a certain planetary
yoga for the North in an area indicated by the Kalachakra in the East,
does that mean we need to have that particular color light shine North
in the Eastern part of the house in order to activate that
force/combination?  How does the light need to be modulated (per
Dwight's technique mentioned previously)?  So gemstones for various
planets or planet combinations should be placed in certain parts of
the room and moved according to the panchanga (if one wants to follow
transits with optimal utilization)?  Natal birth charts would be more
wise to favor in terms of placement of these throughout rooms in the
house though.

Also, I started reading and getting more information about sound
therapy.  There are a sets of frequencies that are said to bring
benefits.  

One is called the Schumann resonance frequencies.
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schumann_resonances

From the above wikipedia article:
"Schumann resonances are the principal background in the electromagnetic spectrum[1] beginning at 3  Hz and extend to 60 Hz,[2] and appear as distinct peaks at extremely low frequencies (ELF) around 7.83 (fundamental),[3] 14.3, 20.8, 27.3 and 33.8 Hz.[4][5]

In the normal mode descriptions of Schumann resonances, the fundamental mode is a standing wave in the Earth–ionosphere cavity with a wavelength equal to the circumference of the Earth. This lowest-frequency (and highest-intensity) mode of the Schumann resonance occurs at a frequency of approximately 7.83 Hz, but this frequency can vary slightly from a variety of factors, such as solar-induced perturbations to the ionosphere, which comprises the upper wall of the closed cavity[citation needed]. The higher resonance modes are spaced at approximately 6.5 Hz intervals[citation needed], a characteristic attributed to the atmosphere's spherical geometry. The peaks exhibit a spectral width of approximately 20% on account of the damping of the respective modes in the dissipative cavity. The eighth overtone lies at approximately 59.9 Hz.[citation needed]"

The other is called the Solfeggio Frequencies.
http://solfeggiofrequencies.net/what-are

From the above website:
"This is the secret behind Solfeggio frequencies and sound therapy. Each Solfeggio tone is comprised of a frequency required to balance your energy and keep your body, mind and spirit in perfect harmony. The main six Solfeggio frequencies are:

396 Hz – Liberating Guilt and Fear
417 Hz – Undoing Situations and Facilitating Change
528 Hz – Transformation and Miracles (DNA Repair)
639 Hz – Connecting/Relationships
741 Hz – Awakening Intuition
852 Hz – Returning to Spiritual Order

The Solfeggio frequencies are not a modern invention. Indeed, they have been known for a long time. Origins of the Solfeggio Frequencies date back to ancient times. They were originally used centuries ago in ancient Gregorian chants. These chants contained special tones which were believed to impart tremendous spiritual blessings during religious ceremonies."

See the webpage for more info on how these frequencies can be deduced
from bible scriptures.  Also, another piece of info to note is that
these measurements are in Hz.  What about the efficacy of these same
relationships instead of in frequency per second, but frequency per
hour, or per day?  Can we convert these relationships to space (three
dimensions)?

Something I need to verify, but was an interesting comment given by a
reviewer post on Amazon.com (need to verify):

"Root Chakra(Base of Spine)- 396Hz
Sacral Chakra(Navel)- 417Hz
Solar Plexus Chakra- 528Hz
Heart Chakra- 639Hz
Throat Chakra- 741Hz
Brow(third eye)Chakra- 852 Hz
Crown Chakra- 963Hz"

So are these frequencies related to each of the chakras?  At higher
octaves, are these frequencies the colors that new-agers say relate to
the particular chakras?

I've bought a CD of these frequencies to try out and test.  If it
works well, I'd like to at some point try to combine both the Schumann
fundamental frequency with these Solffeggio frequencies.  Usually the
CDs with the Schumann frequency (or any other generation method) use
the technique of binaural beats.  Is this (binaural beats) the best
way to get this frequency or should I try to get the isochronic tone
of it?  Also, now that I have more knowledge about directionality, it
may now make sense to be careful about which direction I listen to
these tones from.  Is this (directionality) the reason for the pain
that people sometimes feel from the use of Holosync (i.e. they claim
it is all the cruft getting kicked up, there's a term they use for it,
I can't remember what the term is at the moment)?
