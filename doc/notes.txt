Some thoughts on how things must work in the universe:

Relationship between numbers and geometric shapes

Numbers:              Geometrical shape
1 ^ 1 = 1             point
1 squared is 1        point
1 cubed is 1          point
1^4 is 1              point
1^5 is 1              point
...etc.


All are points in all 5 dimensions.  The number one represents unity (in the spirtual evolutionary sense as well).

Numbers:              Geometrical shape
2 ^ 1                 line
2 squared is 4        square (2-d)
2 cubed is 8          cube (3-d)
2^4 is 16             cube in 4d
2^5 is 32             ...
etc.

The number two represents duality (in the spiritual evolutionary sense as well).  Music is harmonious to us because we are in duality.  This is why dividing a string in half produces the same note an octave higher, and dividing it by 3 produces a perfect fifth.  This point is important as we take into account the tones in music (different tuning temperments, their ratios, and why) and how that should be applied to the markets, from a pure numerical perspective, and then a planetary trendline perspective, which is just the same thing but adapting the phenomena to space-time distortions.


Numbers:              Geometrical shape
3 ^ 1 = 3             
3 ^ 2 = 9             triangle
3 ^ 3 = 27            triangular pyramid
3 ^ 4 = 81            ...
3 ^ 5 = 243            ...
3 ^ 6 = 729            ...
3 ^ 7 = 2187            ...

Numbers:              Geometrical shape
9 squared is 81       ?
9 cubed is 729        ?
9 ^4 is 6561          ?
9 ^5 is 59049          ?

9 is a special number:
If you add the digits of the squared number, they sum up to 9, which was the original root number.  So there is a DIFFERENT KIND OF RELATIONSHIP (exponent to exponent or square to square) going on here.  

Hence, 3 is much more tightly coupled to 9, 81, and 729 than 27, 243, 2187.


In the above, 2 ^ 2 is 2 times 2, and the reproduction produced 4, a different quality.  If you keep incrementing the exponent, the result can be deduced to one of: 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8.  It can not reproduce a number that reduces to a 3 or a 9.  Hence, in reproduction, a 2 yields a reduced 2 every so often (in a pattern).  We should note that 2 ^ x (x incrementing) does produce 3's and 9's in the results at different place digits.  How does this factor into the reproduction of child/derivative numbers?


The above exercise should all be done again for numbers in different radixes.  How does this influence what they get reduced to?


Special numbers:
pi, phi, square roots because squaring them comes to a whole numbers, same with cube-roots, etc.  What are the geometric shapes for these numbers, and then also, what are the geometric shape relationships between the original shape and the ones with one less dimension and one more dimension?



Application:
Trading entities are 'born' in a certain dimension (as are humans).  They have components of each number that make it up, and hence they each have to some degree influences from each geometric shape.  

As noted in the Cowan books, these are actually trying to transcend the current dimension and move to the next.  They try to build the next dimensional object.  There are various ways this is done, depending on the dimension being looked at.  For example, if you have a square and you are trying to build a cube, it is filling up the volume of the cube with something.  The mass contained within teh cube as the cube is being built is not uniform in weight distribution.  So if we know the structure and method at which the square gets built into a cube, we can fractically extrapolate what the end volume and weight will be!  This concept and idea is is how I believe Gann was able to say that a certain trading entity will go to a certain price by a certain time.  

All these ideas in number or geometric shape/solid have their equivalent representation in planetary position, as they are all the same.  So when there are posts by Alblak about translating planetary position to price and back, he is basically doing it for the dominant planet(s), and thus also the dominate geometric shapes/solids that apply to that trading entity.

So at the current moment, I think that the planets in our solar system are just a representation that is equivalent to several different geometric X-dimensional shapes/solids centered at the Sun.  As these shapes/solids build and assemble itself it is what may be the 'tunnel through the air'.   What I should do is calculate the rate of expansion of planetary orbital radiuses, then see how that comes out relative to the mass of the planets/objects in the universe.  Then compare these numbers to the speed at which 'space' is expanding.  In Indian vedic literature, akasa is the space/ether element, and it may have some connection to amritha/soma and other such necters churned from the gods.


Other thoughts:

There must be some special relationship between pi and our universe.  Many of the movements and 3d objects in the universe are spherical.  How and why is this the case???  What is the connection here.  This is a key missing piece.

Could wolf frequencies or pythagorean coma be the phenomena that causes the planets to revolve around the sun, and the sun to revolve around the galactic center?  These MUST play some role in how everything comes together...

How to connect this all with the arrangement of the periodic table and the atomic composition of the elements?

Thoughts I had while waking up this morning.

Scientists and physicists today are trying to make the connection between the Quantum relativistic world and the macro world.  There must be a unifying theory between the two.

When waking up this morning, I had a realization that two points in time must have a gravitational pull towards each other, even though they are massless.  So what this implies is that the equation:

F=G([m1*m2]/D^2)

F is the force of gravity being calculated in Newtons
G is the Gravitational Constant of 6.673E-11 Newtons.
The Ms are the masses of the objects in question.
D is the distance between the centers of the objects.

is just missing a time factor!!!

Is there a time squarted variable in the denominator?    I liken this extension of gravity to the way that the PTV vector is used in price behavior of the markets.



Also, for gravitation pull and effects of astrology (from the the birth moment) there must be a distinction between things with no mass and things with mass.  

Things with no mass are: price behavior of financial markets, ideas, thoughts, and questions asked in prashna.

Massive objects include: humans, planets, cars, cities, etc.


So the factors to consider are:

Space, Time, Matter, Motion? and Energy(light/heat?).

I think Energy is translated to various forms of the above in different ratios according to certain fundamental equations such that there is no loss of energy.


Also, the modified equation for gravity should probably have the representative breakdown utilizing:
- atomic makeup
or 
- makeup according to the 5 elements as defined by the Indians (Agni, Prithvi, Jala, Vaayu, Aakasha)


How does fire exhibit its qualities here in the equations?  Is there something here as to why Gann excludes Mars in his COE/MOF?  There is probably something there to the general 'make-up' of an entity (e.g, humans with water and the moon).  

Also, theoretically, in the same way that it is possible to extract profit from the markets due to knowing the behavior of the energy in it, it should be possible to extract energy from the universe by knowing the behavior of the energy in it as well.

Add rulers for octaves in time (diatonic points):

  Just standard Do-Do sequencing in time.. fractaled octaves are shown if you will..

   DO – 2
   Ti – 1.875
   La – 1.666
   Sol – 1.5
   Fa – 1.333
   Mi - .25
   Re – 1.125
   Do - 1

    Best wishes..
     Tony 

Also, what about octaves in price (per the Gann sq-of-9 and other number charts)?  And what about octaves per the combination of price and time squared?  What I mean by this is trying to figure out octaves in PTV (price-time-vectors).


Also, I need to look at geometric mean, and geometric averages in relation to this as well.


The numbers/ratios of an octave... are they related to the vimsottari dasa sceme in any way?  E.g. Sun + moon dasa length is  6 + 10 = 16, 16 / 120 is 0.13333, matches 'Fa'.  Venus dasa length is 20, 20 / 120 = 0.1666, which is 'La'.  How does this match up with reversal of dasa with the nodes?  Also, what 'note' (planet) we start on in the vimsottari dasa sceme should be important too, to indicate what scale mode the person is running (phrygian, etc.).

What then to make up of conditional dasa schemes?

The arudhas must then vibrate at a certain frequency level too, in order to get activated by new dasas that a person go into.

Kit kat (Alain) says on WITS:
"this is based on price cycles
time cycles
and  geometry"

"well , i think ive found what gann refered to as the master of time,
the beautiful thing in it  is that you need  first to find out   your  philosophical belief of what moves the chart,
then  i must say the way to catch it, is very artistic, it comes out of exact science, but youd  see it on the chart  as  broken reality, theres  no other way to put it  together.
"

##############################################################################

My view:


In a trading entity price chart:

The source is 0 or unity.
When things leave unity, there is diffraction... which is what causes the Gann lines.
'Music' is another name/manifestation of diffraction.
What is diffraction in terms of numbers?  (Numeric dimension?)  Is this numerology.

We need to think about how reproduction happens.  Asexual vs. sexual.  The price chart is probably asexual reproduction.  Was there anything else that Bayer saw?  Reproduction is our mana putras constantly creating our own world... so in a chart there are constantly new 'births' (mayor turning points) that feed the chart in a feedback loop.  How does death happen (and calculated).  What does it mean in the price chart, for both the real birth time/price, and for the subsequent mana putras that get born as the chart is still going?

What happens on the 'other side' as we sleep?  Why is sleep 8 hours of the day or 1/3 of the day?  We are awake 2rds of the day.  How is this related to vimsottari dasa (120 years) out of 360?  We are awake 16 hours of the day on average, so 16/24 = 2/3, which would imply a Vimsottari dasa of 240 years instead of 120.  Why is this?  Is it based off of the duality principle/law?  (think AK and DK, MK and PiK).

Time is an illusion, as the start/birth point exists really in multiple points in time.  That is why we draw the Gann lines from 0.  The 0 lines are the diffraction from the source.  We also need to draw the diffraction (gann) lines from earlier points in time as well, before birth.  

Broken reality that kit kat talks about is likely the effect of the narayana dasa.  Movement... so broken in a fractal way.  Did Bayer see these dasas in a different way?

We need to think about where we are in the universe and how it differs from expected 'perfection' of manifestation.  This goes to see what the basis or mathematical deravation of Vimsottari dasa and the other dasas are.  Is Vimsottari dasa based off of this same refraction?  360 being the 'whole'?  (of which 120 out of 360 years forms)... Or is it a bigger number and we are just working the part of it within it?  

How do we fit tithis, karanas, varas, etc.  into all of this?  These must be fractal as well (and/or have diffraction) and interweve with all the other concepts/methods.

Why is the Rasi so important?  
  12 dimensions of the sun?  Upon what does this get derived?

Why is navamsa so important?  
  2^2 --> 4
  3^3 --> 9

  It is duality with those two numbers.

Why is shashyamsa so important?  
  Think about this.

What is the basis behind dig bala?  What is up with the PDFs I downloaded that talk about the false sun location?  I think Walter Russell talks about this too.  This is related, but why is reality in this situation important?  Why are the dig bala locations of planets all in kendras, and what is the significance of being in dig bala in a certain North, South, East, West, etc.  

How do the shapes and lines get traced as per Nassim Haramein?  Gann says that the markets are like building a house.  This is highlighting the fractal nature upon which the markets are being built.  The torus is key and an important part.  Is the rotating Cube really rotating?  Maybe not and maybe it is just the perception of it while we move in time... of which time is non-linear.

Things to think about are how the Nakshatras play into this.  Nakshatras being 3^3 as well as 9^2, so it exists both in the realm of duality and 3-ality.  What does it mean when there is parivartana in the Nakshatras?  What does it mean when there is parivartana in the Rasi?  We need to make sure we understand how it works with the kalachakra (prana flow).  

What is Gann's talk about mass, pressure, and temperature?  What are these attributes in a chart?  Compared to a human, mass of our body forms from our energy body.  Think more on this...




3 topics to elaborate on/think about:

1) The Gann number charts (sq-of-9, hexagon number chart, etc.)  probably are used as per the different parts of the 3-d/4-d Geometric figures (Tetrahedron, Octahedron, etc., from The Haramein video), as the growth/decay pattern is playing itself out.

2) Vimsottari Dasa (and other dasas) in Vedic astrology are probably not of the whole full spectrum (musical ratios/octaves), but maybe working out a fractal part of the whole spectrum.  This is why they say Vimsottari works best and is most versatile in Kali Yuga.  What about Rasi dasas?  Are they playing out in a similar way or are they playing out per the whole spectrum range?  

2) Diffraction is what happens when all things of manifestation move from unity to duality.  This is what causes music in pythagorean ratios.  This happens in all dimensions (physical, time, etc.).  

Double and single slit experiment: and how it is related to arudhas of houses and planets, both exact, and by degree.  What about other points like the midheaven, and their bases on which astrological houses are created.  This is probably why the house systems are split into 3's where the decendant and midheaven cross.  

How this relates to chemistry (in terms of full spectrum, and the slit from which things get diffracted when leaving the source/unity)?  What are the 'slits' in our physical universe/galaxy?  What about the precession of the equinoxes as a slit point?  

Huang Po's Tranmission of Mind, from page X.  Our greatness and unity comes from tapping and being one with that original one source that is common to all things.  I was realizing while reading this that all our sense organs rely on mutual exchange of similar sense-type to detect that physical phenomena.  For example, to determine something's texture, we have to touch it... and in touching it it is also touching us.  What we touch with (our hand/finger) also pressed on something else and touches something else (our muscle/tissue in the hand), which touches something else, and on and on through which there may be conversions to other types of manifest vibration.  Another example is sight... when we see a color with our eyes, at the same time, the eyes are reflecting a color back as well, so in reality light is being reflected around and our senses are not truly independent to be able to adequately/properly measure reality.

- Geometry: Explore the relationship of numbers in the Geometric solids.  Not only between square and sphere as is done in all the books, but also the archimedies solids.  How do these solids warp or transform to others between them all?  Are there combinations between 3 shapes for solids (Archimedies solids only utilize 2 shapes).

Based on my understanding of how Vimsottari dasa gets affected by Rahu and Ketu (conjoining the maha dasa lord in the same rasi reverses the antar dasa order), this is very similar to musical modal scales.

Also, the 'shifting' of cycles that people on WITS talk about is likely due to rasi dasas (like Narayana) or something similar that cause the chart to jump around.

Bayer talks about 'reflex' points, which act like the planet itself.  Here I think he is talking about arudhas.  So explore this with both graha arudhas and rasi arudhas.  

Study nakshatra aspects and nakshatra graha aspects.

Also study magic squares.  The first price that a trading entity logs is likely important, and so is the movement immediately after that first price.  But how does this fit in with magic squares?  How to match up that first open price with the astrology chart?  

I believe that the varga (rasi) chakras may just be magic squares.
Same with the nakshatra chakra and the kalachakra.  The greeks were obsessed with number and were knowledgeable enough about astrology and numbers to know about nakshatras in astrology, and its' mapping to greek letters and numerology for naming people.  So this knowledge of magic squares was with the Greeks.  Also, in Chinese philosophy, in I Ching and Chinese astrology, the 8 directions are given huge importance and 8 is an auspicious number.  Their I Ching and Chinese astrology are all based on magic squares and numbers.  It is said that even fung shui is based on these as well.  How can Indian thought in the field of the occult not be based on it?  Is this the geometry that the Risis were trying to highlight when writing out the Vedas?  I know that the letters in Sanskrit correspond to numbers, so are their hymns and mantras just magic square numbers recited to become actually living and manifest?

Thinking more on the topic of Vedic Geometry, and the whole Vedas and the gods i
n the Vedas as numerical and geometric constructs, it is possible that what the Vedas are describing are different configurations of magic squares/cubes.  This realization came after seeing some writing behind the 'Siva Purana (retold)' about 14000 Indas making a Brahma.  This is along the lines of what S.K. Kapoor talks about in his Vedic Mathematics and Vedic Geometry books.


In one of the WITS emails, Lorin talks about the Gann 'moving averages' and how they have a particular look-period amount.  I think the moving averages here is referring to planetary longitude averages like the MOF and the COE.  What is the look-back period that he is referring to?  I starred the email that Lorin sent referring to this.  It seemed he didn't want to speak more about the topic.  My speculation is that the lookback period is based on amount of time or price or distance of previous market legs... or perhaps it is related to rasi or nakshatra or other types of dasas.

I've been reading more about magic squares, magic cubes, magic circles
and magic stars.  Apparently they extend to additional multiple
dimensions as well.  I think this is what Gann was speaking of when he
said that markets are constructed just like building a house.  First
you construct the foundation, then you build the walls, and finally
you construct the ceiling.  


So a each leg in a bull run in the market is the construction of
smaller squares or cubes that build a larger cube that makes up the
bull run.

Something interesting is that in Indian religion/philosophy, there is
a magic triangle for durga.  Apparently there is also one for ganesh
that is a 3x3 magic square.  I think all the yantras are constructions
of these numerical magic geometric constructs.  The mantra is probably
invoking the numbers and the constructs that are on the yantra.  Is
there an optimal distance to view the yantra from?  Optimal pitch(es)
to chant the mantra, optimal breath (amount and interval) and at an
optimal volume?  And are we supposed to change our focus on various
points on the yantra based on where we are in the mantra corresponding
to the number?  These are mysteries that may yield answers upon longer
reflection and research.  

So the current conclusion I have is that ALL yantras are magic
mathematical geometric figures, and they are associated with their
diety, and those have a relationship to number and structure as well,
based on how many eyes, heads, arms, and where there is scripture
written about them in the Vedas.

Are dasas in jyotish just these magic squares/cubes/spheres being
built and transformed?  (either rotated, or inverted, etc.)

Something to look at more closely is the 27x27 magic square.  Is this
related to Jyotish?  27 is the number of Nakshatras, and if you look
at it, the 9x9 subsquare may be related to the number of padas in a
Rasi, and the edge of the 27x27 square, if counting by 9's make up 12
faces, which may coorespond to a Rasi (sun sign).

Also, think more about how these could possibly be related to the
sq-of-9 and hexagon number chart and other number charts that Gann
used.
