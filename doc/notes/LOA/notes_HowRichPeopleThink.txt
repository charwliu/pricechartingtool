##############################################################################

pg. 17

The rich are masters at focusing their mental energy where it belongs: on the big money.  How about you?  Are you more focused on saving pennies or building an empire?  

pg. 18

Based on your past behaviors and results, are you thinking big or small?  Make a decision today to think bigger and maximize your money potential.  

pg. 19

The great people are masters at generating money through ideas that solve problems.  They realize since there is no limit to ideas, there is no limit to how money they can earn.  

pg. 20

Use of leverage creates wealth.

pg. 22

First you build world-class beliefs around money, then you take action based on those beliefs.  Your results will follow your actions.  

pg. 23

Decide to be proud of your ambition, and ignore people who tell you wanting to be rich is wrong.  

pg. 23-24

World-class thinkers know in a capitalist country, they have the right to be rich if they're willing to create massive value for others.  They believe if they make life better or easier for others, it's their right to be rich.  

It's possible for anyone living in a society that rewards problem solving.  The great ones believe they have the right to be as rich as the value they create.  



While the masses are watching television and surfing the web, champions are thinking, working, and dreaming of a better life.  

Be laser focused on new ideas that have the potential to build wealth.  


World-class thinkers know money flows from ideas.  They know the more value they create in the marketplace, the wealthier they will become.  Getting rich in a free market economy is simply a matter of trading solutions for money.  The bigger the solution, the bigger the paycheck.  It's that simple.  

Their mindset is rooted in the abundant potential every new idea presents, and they live in a consciousness full of excitement and grand anticipation.  


pg. 27

The average person believes rich people acquire wealth through dishonest and deceit.  People use this to justify their own mediocrity.  Every socio-economic sub-group has people who earn money illegally, but the percentage is no different in the upper class than the lower class. 

World-class thinkers know the majority of fortunes were built through ambition, drive and vision.  


Don't waste brainpower on excuses and blame, but instead, focus on taking action and getting results.  Harness creativity and solve bigger problems.  


The ambition of the self-made rich individual comes from self-confidence and an ability to use throught and perseverance to get what they want.  

pg. 29

The world class knows it takes a team to build wealth, and they focus much of their effort on finding the right people to leverage their actions and ideas.  The greatest fortunes are built through the collective mental and physical contributions of a world-class team.  The rich see themselves as teamleaders, whether their teams consist of employees, partners, or outsourced contractors.  

pg. 31

While the masses are mentally mired in thoughts of fear and scarcity, the rich are operating in a mindset of love, abundance, and endless possibility.  They value peace of mind and absence of fear.  

pg. 32

Redirect all the energy you spend worrying about money towards building your fortune.  

Money is a positive tool that has the power to create freedom and opportunity for oneself and family.  

The rich fund most of charity money, and contribute the most to government tax revenue.  

[rluu: Are many charities a wasted effort because they do not cure the underlying problem?  Charities only temporarily remove the symptoms of an underlying problem.  You must believe in the charity organization you are associating/working with (you have to believe in their mission and their plan of action.).  ]

pg. 36

The road to riches is paved with specific knowledge (self-education).  
Many of the wealthy have specific knowledge that they can trade for a fortune.

pg. 38
