Notes on the book: "The Kybalion" by Three Initiates.
##############################################################################

rluu 20120702: Having finished reading this book, the most important pages are pages 56 to 58, where the author summaries the major concepts of the book and gives the practical techniques for transmutation.  I've taken notes on those 3 pages, see that specific section below.

pg. 6

Hermes Trismegistus: He was the father of the Occult Wisdom; the founder of Astrology; the discoverer of Alchemy.  

As the years rolled by after his passing from this plane of life (tradition recording that he lived three hundred years in the flesh), the Egyptians deified Hermes, and made him one of their gods, under the name of Thoth. Years after, the people of Ancient Greece also made him one of their many gods–calling him “Hermes, the god of Wisdom.” The Egyptians revered his memory for many centuries–yes, tens of centuries–.calling him “the Scribe of the Gods,” and bestowing upon him, distinctively, his ancient title, “Trismegistus,” which means ''the thrice-great”; “the great-great”; “the greatest-great”; etc. In all the ancient lands, the name of Hermes Trismegistus was revered, the name being synonymous with the “Fount of Wisdom.”

pg. 7

"The Art of Hermetic Alchemy", which, contrary to the general belief, dealt in the mastery of Mental Forces, rather than Material Elements–the Transmutation of one kind of Mental Vibrations into others. instead of the changing of one kind of metal into another. The legends of the “Philosopher's Stone” which would turn base metal into Gold, was an allegory relating to Hermetic Philosophy, readily understood by all students of true Hermeticism.

pg. 9

The Seven Hermetic Principles, upon which Hermetic Philosophy is based are:
I.   THE PRINCIPLE OF MENTALISM.
II.  THE PRINCIPLE OF CORRESPONDENCE.
III. THE PRINCIPLE OF VIBRATION.
IV.  THE PRINCIPLE OF POLARITY.
V.   THE PRINCIPLE OF RHYTHM.
VI.  THE PRINCIPLE OF CAUSE AND EFFECT.
VII. THE PRINCIPLE OF GENDER.


“THE ALL is MIND; The Universe is Mental.” -The Kybalion.

The phenomenal world or universe is simply a Mental Creation of THE ALL, subject to the Laws of Created Things, and that the universe, as a whole, and in its parts or units, has its existence in the Mind of THE ALL, in which Mind we “live and move and have our being.”

The Master-Key [of Hermetic Philosophy] is the truth of the Mental Nature of the Universe.

pg. 11

The Hermetist understands the art of transmuting Evil into Good, by means of an application of the Principle of Polarity. In short, the “Art of Polarization” becomes a phase of “Mental Alchemy” known and practiced by the ancient and modern Hermetic Masters. An understanding of the Principle will enable one to change his own Polarity, as well as that of others, if he will devote the time and study necessary to master the art.

In everything there is manifested a measured motion, to and fro; a flow and inflow; a swing backward and forward; a pendulum-like movement; a tide-like ebb and flow; a high-tide and low-tide; between the two poles which exist in accordance with the Principle of Polarity described a moment ago.

The Hermetist applies the Mental Law of Neutralization. They cannot annul the Principle, or cause it to cease its operation, but they have learned how to escape its effects upon themselves to a certain degree depending upon the Mastery of the Principle.

pg. 12

“Every Cause has its Effect; every Effect has its Cause; everything happens according to Law; Chance is but a name for Law not recognized; there are many planes of causation, but nothing escapes the Law.” -The Kybalion.

“Gender is in everything; everything has its Masculine and Feminine Principles; Gender manifests on all planes.” -The Kybalion.


pg. 14

“Mind (as well as metals and elements) may be transmuted, from state to state; degree to degree; condition to condition; pole to pole; vibration to vibration. True Hermetic Transmutation is a Mental Art.” -The Kybalion.

Mental Transmutation is the “Art of Mental Chemistry”.

If the Universal is Mental in its nature, then Mental Transmutation must be the art of CHANGING THE CONDITIONS OF THE UNIVERSE, along the lines of Matter, Force and Mind. So you see, therefore, that Mental Transmutation is really the “Magic” of which the ancient writers had so much to say in their mystical works, and about which they gave so few practical instructions.

pg. 15

Mental Alchemists have been able to attain the degree of power necessary to control the grosser physical conditions, such as the control of the elements of Nature; the production or cessation of tempests; the production and cessation of earthquakes and other great physical phenomena.

pg. 16

Nothing endures but Change. And if he be a thinking man, he realizes that all of these changing things must be but outward appearances or manifestations of some Underlying Power–some substantial Reality.

This Substantial Reality is known by the Hermetic name of “THE ALL”.

The inner nature of THE ALL is UNKNOWABLE.

pg. 17

“THAT which is the Fundamental Truth–the Substantial Reality–is beyond true naming, but the Wise Men call it THE ALL. “ -The Kybalion.

“In its Essence, THE ALL is UNKNOWABLE.” -The Kybalion.

1) THE ALL must be ALL that REALLY IS.
2) THE ALL must be INFINITE
3) THE ALL must be IMMUTABLE

pg. 18

“THE ALL” is Infinite Living Mind–the Illumined call it SPIRIT.

pg. 19

“The Universe is Mental–held in the Mind of THE ALL.” -The Kybalion.

[rluu: FYI, my personal definition of the Universe is actually what this text is describing as "The All."  What he uses or means by "Universe" in this text is galaxy or perhaps the manifest worlds/realms.]


The Universe is not THE ALL, because the Universe seems to be made up of MANY, and is constantly changing, and in other ways it does not measure up to the ideas that we are compelled to accept regarding THE ALL.


How does Man create?  He CREATES MENTALLY! And in so doing he uses no outside materials, nor does he reproduce himself, and yet his Spirit pervades the Mental Creation.

pg. 20

THE ALL creates the Universe MENTALLY, in a manner akin to the process whereby Man creates Mental Images.

THE UNIVERSE, AND ALL IT CONTAINS, IS A MENTAL CREATION OF THE ALL. Verily, indeed, ALL IS MIND!


“Gender” means “relating to generation or creation.”

If you prefer the old figures of thought, you umay think of the Masculine Principle as GOD, the Father, and of the Feminine Principle as NATURE, the Universal Mother, from whose womb all things have been born.

[rluu: This is basically the same as the Indian concepts of Purusha and Prakriti.]


pg. 21

You are dwelling in the Infinite Mind of THE ALL, and your possibilities and opportunities are infinite, both in time and space. And at the end of the Grand Cycle of Aeons, when THE ALL shall draw back into itself all of its creations–you will go gladly, for you will then be able to know the Whole Truth of being At One with THE ALL. Such is the report of the Illumined–those who have advanced well along The Path.

“Within the Father-Mother Mind, mortal children are at home.” -The Kybalion.


pg. 22

The Law of Paradox is an aspect of the Princple of Polarity.  

Absolute Truth has been defined as “Things as the mind of God knows them,” while Relative Truth is “Things as the highest reason of Man understands them.” And so while to THE ALL the Universe must be unreal and illusionary, a mere dream or result of meditation–nevertheless, to the finite minds forming a part of that Universe, and viewing it through mortal faculties, the Universe is very real indeed, and must be so considered.

pg. 24

Herbert Spencer:
The Hermetic Teachings have no fault to find with Herbert Spencer’s basic principle which postulates the existence of an “Infinite and Eternal Energy, from which all things proceed.” In fact, the Hermetics recognize in Spencer’s philosophy the highest outside statement of the workings of the Natural Laws that have ever been promulgated.

Heraclitus, the Grecian philosopher who lived B.C. 500

“THE ALL is Mind; the Universe is Mental–held in the Mind of THE ALL.”

pg. 25

“Use Law against Laws; the higher against the lower; and by the Art of Alchemy transmute that which is undesirable into that which is worthy, and thus triumph.”

pg. 26

“While All is in THE ALL, it is equally true that THE ALL is in All. To him who truly understands this truth hath come great knowledge.” -The Kybalion.


The Hermetic Teachings are to the effect that THE ALL is Imminent in (“remaining within; inherent; abiding within”) its Universe, and in every part, particle, unit, or combination, within the Universe. This statement is usually illustrated by the Teachers by a reference to the Principle of Correspondence. The Teacher instructs the student to form a mental Image of something, a person, an idea, something having a mental form, the favorite example being that of the author or dramatist forming an idea of his characters; or a painter or sculptor forming an image of an ideal that he wishes to express by his art. In each case, the student will find that while the image has its existence, and being, solely within his own mind, yet he, the student, author, dramatist, painter, or sculptor, is, in a sense, immanent in; remaining within; or abiding within, the mental image also. In other words, the entire virtue, life, spirit, of reality in the mental image is derived from the “immanent mind” of the thinker.

“The Spirit of my Creator is inherent within me–and yet I am not HE!”

pg. 27

And, in the degree that Man realizes the existence of the Indwelling Spirit immanent within his being, so will he rise in the spiritual scale of life. This is what spiritual development means–the recognition, realization, and manifestation of the Spirit within us.

All are on the Path, whose end is THE ALL. All progress is a Returning Home.

pg. 29

THE ALL is Its Own Reason; its own Law; its own Act.


[rluu: As of 20120702, I've read the whole book and highlighted the important portions, but I did not take electronic notes for everything from page 30 to page 55 (inclusive).  I'm not sure if it's worth coming back to fill in the rest of the notes.  There is a lot of repetition and the most important parts are on pages 56 to 58.]

MOST IMPORTANT PAGES:
pg. 56, 57, 58


“The possession of Knowledge, unless accompanied by a manifestation and expression in Action, is like the hoarding of precious metals–a vain and foolish thing. Knowledge, like Wealth, is intended for Use. The Law of Use is Universal, and he who violates it suffers by reason of his conflict with natural forces.“ -The Kybalion.

Study the Axioms and Aphorisms, but practice them also.



“To change your mood or mental state–change your vibration.”–The Kybalion.

One may change his mental vibrations by an effort of Will, in the direction of deliberately fixing the Attention upon a more desirable state. Will directs the Attention, and Attention changes the Vibration. Cultivate the Art of Attention, by means of the Will, and you have solved the secret of the Mastery of Moods and Mental States.


“To destroy an undesirable rate of mental vibration, put into operation the Principle of Polarity and concentrate upon tile opposite pole to that which you desire to suppress. Kill out the undesirable by changing its polarity.”–The Kybalion.



By changing your polarity you may master your moods, change your mental states, remake your disposition, and build up character.  By this, one can overcome their ordinary environment, and thus become practically players instead of mere pawns.  


The mastery of Polarization is the mastery of the fundamental principles of Mental Transmutation or Mental Alchemy, for unless one acquires the art of changing his own polarity, he will be unable to affect his environment. An understanding of this principle will enable one to change his own Polarity, as well as that of others.


“Rhythm may be neutralized by an application of the Art of Polarization.”–The Kybalion.

The Law of Neutralization enables one, to a great extent, to overcome the operation of Rhythm in consciousness.

By an understanding of the practice of Polarization, the Hermetists rise to a higher plane of Causation and thus counter-balance the laws of the lower planes of Causation.



The Universe being wholly mental, it follows that it may be ruled only by Mentality.


“THE ALL is MIND; The Universe is Mental.”–The Kybalion.
