Notes on "The Four Agreements" by Don Miguel Ruiz.
##############################################################################

From the front jacket cover:

The Four Agreements:

1) Be Impeccable with your word.
Speak with integrity.  Say only what you mean.  Avoid using the word to speak against yourself or to gossip about others.  Use the power of your word in the direction of truth and love.  

2) Don't take anything personally.
Nothing others do is because of you.  What others say and do is a projection of their own reality, their own dream.  When you are immune to the opinions and actions of others, you won't be the victim of needless suffering.  

3) Don't make assumptions.
Find the courage to ask questions and to express what you really want.  Communicate with others as clearly as you can to avoid misunderstandings, sadness, and drama.  With just this one agreement, you can completely transform your life.  

4) Always do your best.  
Your best is going to change from moment to moment; it will be different when you are healthy as opposed to sick.  Under any circumstance, simply do your best, and you will avoid self-judgement, self-abuse, and regret.

pg. xvi

Everything is made of light.  It's not the stars that create light, but rather light that creates the stars.  

"tonal" == the stars
"nagual" == the light between the stars. 

Life, or Intent, creates the harmony and space between the "tonal" and the "nagual".


pg. xvii
Everything in existence is a manifestation of the one living being we call God.  Everything is God.  Human perception is merely light perceiving light.  Matter is a mirror -- everythign is a mirror that reflects light and creates images of that light -- and the world of illusion, the 'Dream', is just like smoke which doesn't allow us to see what we really are.  The real us is pure love, pure light.  

pg. xviii

Everyone is a mirror.  He [the ancient wise man] saw himself in everyone.  He said "I am the Smokey Mirror, because I am looking at myself in all of you, but we don't recognize each other because of the smoke in-between us.  That smoke is the 'Dream', and the mirror is you, the dreamer."

pg. 1, 2

What you are seeing and hearing right now is nothing but a dream.  You are dreaming right now in this moment.  You are dreaming with the brain awake.  Dreaming is the main function fo the mind, and the mind dreams 24 hours a day.  It dreams when the brain is awake, and it also dreams when the brain is asleep.  The difference is that when the brain is awake, there is a material frame that makes us perceive things in a linear way.  When we go to sleep, we do not have the frame, and the dream has the tendency to change constantly.  

The dream of the planet is the collective dream of billions of smaller, personal dreams, which together create a dream of a family, a dream of a community, a dream of a city, a dream of a country, and finally a dream of the whole humanity.  The dream of the planet includes all of society's rules, its beliefs, its laws, its religions, and its different cultures.  

pg. 5

As children, we agreed with the information that was passed to us from the dream of the planet via other humans.  The only way to store information is by agreement.  The outside dream may hook our attention, but if we don't agree, we don't store that information.  As soon as we agree, we believe it, and this is called faith.  To have faith is to believe unconditionally.  Our faith is so strong that the belief system controls our whole dream of life.  

pg. 6

Domestication of humans (through a belief system) [of reward and punishment].

pg. 9

The belief system is like a Book of Law that rules our mind.  Without question, whatever is in that Book of Law, is our truth.  We base all of our judgements according to the Book of Law, even if these judgments go against our inner nature.  

Every time we make an agreement, the agreement goes into the Book of Law, and these agreements rule our dream.

pg. 10

The inner Judge uses what is in our Book of Law to judge everything we do and don't do, everything we think and don't think, and everything we feel and don't feel.  When we do something that goes against the Book of Law, the Judge says we are guilty and we need to be punished.  

There is another part of us that receives the judgements, and this part is called the Victim.  The Victim carries the blame, the guilt, and the shame.  It is the part of us that says we are not good enough, or not worthy enough, or not worthy of love.  The inner Judge agrees.  And all this is based on a belief system.  
pg. 11

Anything that challenges your Book of Law is going to make you feel unsafe.  Even if the Book of Law is wrong, it makes you feel safe.  

pg. 14

Current society's dream is ruled by fear, pain, and suffering.  

pg. 16

We live in a fog that is not even real.  This fog is a dream, your personal dream of life -- what you believe, all the concepts you have about what you are, all the agreements you have mad with yourself and even with God.  Your whole mind is a fog which the Toltecs called a "mitote" (pronounced "mih-toe-tay").  Your mind is a dream where a thousand people talk at the same time, and nobody understands each other.  In India, they call the mitote "maya", which means illusion.  It is the personality's notion of "I am".  Everythign you believe about yourself and the world, all the concepts and programming you have in your mind are the mitote.  

"mitote" == The fog of the mind.  The dream, or maya.  Your belief systems (about yourself and about the world).  All the concepts and programming in your mind.  

pg. 19

Humans punish themselves endlessly for not being what they believe they should be.  Nobody abuses us more than we abuse ourselves, and it is the Judge, the Victim, and the belief system that make us do this.  

pg. 21, 22, 23

To live a life of joy and fulfillment, you have to find the courage to break agreements that are fear-based and claim your personal power.  The agreements that come from fear require us to expend a lot of energy, but the agreements that come from love help us to conserve energy and even gain extra energy.  

Each time you break an agreement [based on fear], all the power you used to create it returns to you.  Implementing the four agreements [in this book] will create enough personal power for you to change the entire system of your old agreements.  

pg. 25, 26

First agreement: Be impeccable with your word.  

pg. 31 

Impeccable means without sin.  A sin is anything that you do, feel, or believe, which goes against yourself.  

pg. 26

The Word:

Through the word, you express your creative power.  Regardless of what language you speak, your intent manifests through the word.  The word is not just a sound or a written symbol.  The word is a force; it is the power you have to express and communicate, to think, and thereby to create the events in your life.  The word is the most powerful tool you have as a human; it is the tool of magic.  The word is a double-edged sword.  Depending upon how it is used, the word can set you free, or it can enslave you even more than you know.  

pg. 28

The human mind is like a fertile ground where seeds are continually being planted.  The seeds are opinions, ideas, and concepts.  You plant a seed, a thought, and it grows.  The word is like a seed, and the human mind is so fertile!  The ony problem is that too often it is fertile for the seeds of fear.


Every human is a magician, and we can either put a spell on someone with our word, or we can release someone from a spell.  We cast spells all the time with our opinions.  If someone accepts the opinion, then it becomes an agreement, and it enters their Book of Law.  

pg. 37

Gossip is black magic at its very worst because it is pure poison.  

pg. 43

Opinions comes from your beliefs, your own ego, and your own dream.  

If we become impeccable with our word, any emotional poison will eventually be cleaned from our mind and from our communication in our personal relationships.  

pg. 44

You can measure the impeccability of your word by your level of self-love.  How much you love yourself and how you feel about yourself are directly proportionate to the quality and integrity of your word.  When you are impeccable with your word, you feel good; you feel happy and at peace.  

Being impeccable with your word will change the kind of seeds your mind is fertile for (from fear-based seeds to joy/love-based seeds).  

pg. 45

Impeccability of the word can lead you to personal freedom, to huge success and abundacne.  

Tell yourself how wonderful you are, how great you are.  Tell yourself how much you love yourself.  


pg. 47

Second agreement:  Don't take anything personally.

Nothing other people say or do is because of you.  It is because of themselves.  All people live in their own ream, in their own mind; they are in a completely different world from the one we live in.  What they say, what they do, and the opinions they give are according to the agreements they have in their own minds.  Their point of view comes from all the programming they received during domestication and the development of their belief system.

pg. 53

Don't take anything personally.  This means both positive and negative comments.  It is nothing personal.  They are not saying that because of you, but because of their own belief system.  

pg. 54, 55, 56

The mind lives in more than one dimension.  The mind is divided as your body is divided.  The mind can both talk and listen to itself.  It is a big problem when a thousand parts of your mind are all speaking at the same time.  The programming of the mind -- all those agreements we have made -- are not necessarily compatible with each other.  Every agreement is like a separate living being; it has its own personality and its own voice.  There are conflicting agreements that go against other agreements, and on and on until it becomes a big war in the mind.  
pg. 63

Third agreement: Don't make assumptions.

We have a tendency to make assumptions about everything.  The problem with making assumptions is that we believe they are the truth.  We could swear they are real.  It is always better to ask questions than to make an assumption, because assumptions set us up for suffering.  

pg. 72

The way to keep yourself from making assumptions is to ask questions.  Make sure the communication is clear.  If you don't understand, ask.  Once you hear the answer, you will not have to make assumptions becasue you will know the truth.  


Find your voice to ask for what you want.  Everyone has the right to tell you yes or no, but you always have the right to ask.  Likewise, everybody has the right to ask you, and you have the right to say yes or no.  

Without making assumptions, your word becomes impeccable.  

pg. 73, 74

Information or an idea is merely the seed in your mind.  What will really make the difference is action.  Taking the action over and over again strengthens your will, nurtures the seed, and establishes a solid foundation for the new habit to grow.  After many repetitions these new agreements will become second nature, and you will see how the magic of your word transforms you from a black magician into a white magician.  

 A white magician uses the word for creation, giving, sharing and loving.  

pg. 75

Fourth agreement: Always do your best.  

Under any circumstance, always do your best, no more and no less.  But keep in mind your best is never going to be the same from one moment to the next moment.  

pg. 77

Just do your best, in any circumstance in your life.  It doesn't matter if you are sick or tired; if you always do your best there is no way you can judge yourself.  And if you don't judge yourself there is no way you are going to suffer from guilt, blame, and self-punishment.  

pg. 87

Your own body is a manifestation of God, and if you honor your body, everything will change for you.  When you practice giving love to every part of your body, you plant seeds of love in your mind, and when they grow, you will love, honor, and respect your body immensely.  Every action then becomes a ritual in which you are honoring God.  After that, the next step is honoring God with every thought, every emotion, every belief, even what is "right" or "wrong."

pg. 88

You can make a commitment to this agreement today: I choose to honor the Four Agreements.  Always do your best to keep these agreements, and if you fail, then stand back up and reaffirm the agreements again.

pg. 100

Mastery of Awareness: Being aware of who we really are, with all the possibilities.

Mastery of Transformation: How to change, how to be free of domestication.

Mastery of Intent:  Intent from the Toltec point of view is that part of life that makes transformation of energy possible; it is the one living being that seamlessly encompasses all energy, or what we call "God."  Intent is life itself; it is unconditional love.  The Mastery of Intent is therefore the Mastery of Love.  
pg. 105

The Art of Transformation: The dream of the second attention.

The first attention is when you are a child and are innocent.  
The second attention is when you are older and can consciously re-direct your attention for the second time to change your agreements and beliefs, to create a new dream.  

pg. 106

The first step is to become aware of the fog that is in your mind.  You must become aware that you are dreaming all the time.  Only with awareness do you have the possibility of transforming your dream.  

pg. 105

The next step is to develop awareness of all the self-limiting and fear-based beliefs that make you unhappy.  This is because you have to know which agreements you want to change before you can change them.  You take an inventory of all that you believe, all your agreements, and through this process (The Four Agreements), you begin the transformation.  

pg. 108

Start by breaking agreements that are small and require less power.  Then as your personal power increases, you can finally face the bigger fear-based agreements in your mind.  


pg. 109

For every agreement you break that makes you suffer, you will need to replace it with a new agreement that makes you happy.  By occupying the same space with a new agreement, you will keep the old agreement from coming back.  

There are many strong beliefs in the mind that can make this process look hopeless.  This is why you need to go step-by-step and be patient with yourself because this is a slow process.  

pg. 110

We put the power of the word (which is the power of our will) into every previous agreement we have made.  We need the same amount of power to change an agreement.  

Old agreements which rule our dream life are the result of repeating them over and over again.  Therefore to adopt the Four Agreements, we need to put repetition into action.  Practicing the new agreements in your life is how your best becomes better.  

pg. 113

In today's world, every human has an emotional body completely covered with infected wounds.  We have a dysfunctional dream of the planet, and humans are mentally sick with a disease called fear.  The cure is first to forgive those we feel have wronged us.  Forgiveness is the only way to heal.  It is the way to let go of the emotional poison.  Once you forgive all others, you can finally forgive yourself.  Once you forgive yourself, the self-rejection in your mind is over.  Self-acceptance begins, and the self-love will grow so strong that you will finally accept yourself just the way you are.  That's the beginning of the free human.  Forgiveness is the key.  

You will know you have forgiven someone when you see them or hear their name, and you no longer have an emotional reaction.  

pg. 118

Embracing the angel of death:  The angel of death can teach us to live each day as if it was our last day.  

Don't send out emotional poisons because if you die the next day, you will feel regret for that, and you will Judge yourself harshly.  You might even feel regret for not telling someone how much you love them.  

pg. 122

For every moment that is past, the angel of death keeps taking the part that is dead and we keep living in the present.  

The parasite (the Judge, the Victim, and the belief system) wants us to carry the past with us and that makes it so heavy to be alive.  When we try to live in the past, how can we enjoy the present?  

pg. 123-127

The dream you are living is your creation.  It is your perception of reality that you can change at any time.  You have the power to create hell, and you have the power to create heaven.  Why not dream a different dream?  

Just use your imagination and a tremendous thing will happen.  

Imagine that you have the ability to see the world with different eyes, whenever you choose.  Each time you open your eyes, you see the world around you in a different way.  Close your eyes now, and then open them and look outside.  What you will see is love coming out of the trees, love coming out of the sky, love coming out of the light.  You will perceive love from everything around you.  This is the state of bliss.  You perceive love directly from everything, including yourself and other humans.  Even when humans are sad or angry, behind these feelings you can see that they are also sending love.  

Using your imagination and your new eyes of perception, see yourself living a new life, a new dream, a life where you don't need to justify your existence and you are free to be who you really are.  Imagine that you have permission to be happy and to really enjoy your life.  Your life is free of conflict with yourself and with others.  Imagine living your life without fear of expressing your dreams.  You are free to change your life the way you really want to.  You are not afraid to ask for what you need, to say yes or no to anything or anyone.  

Imagine living your life without the fear of being judged by others.  You no longer rule your behavior according to what others may think about you.  You are no longer responsible for anyone's opinion.  You have no need to control anyone, and no one controls you either.  Imagine living your life without judging others.  You can easily forgive others and let go of any judgements that you have.  You don't have the need to be right, and you don't need to make anyone else wrong.  You respect yourself and everyone else, and they respect you in return.  

Imagine you are no longer afriad to be rejected, and you don't have the need to be accepted.  You can walk in the world with your heart completely open, and not be afraid to be hurt.  

Imagine living your life without being afraid to take a risk and to explore life.  You are not afraid to lose anything.  You are not afraid to be alive in the world, and you are not afraid to die.  

Imagine that you love yourself just the way you are.  You love your body just the way it is, and you love your emotions just the way they are.  You know that you are perfect just as you are.  

All these things imagined are entirely possible!

pg. 128

You can be loving all the time.  This is your choice.  You can love because to love makes you so happy.  Love in action only produces happiness.  Love will give you inner peace.  It will change your perception of everything.  

pg. 129

There is no reason to suffer.  The only reason you suffer is because you choose to suffer.  The same is true for happiness.  The only reason you are happy is because you choose to be happy.  They are both choices.  

pg. 131-138

Prayers.
