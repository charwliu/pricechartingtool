# Notes on 'Think And Grow Rich' by Napoleon Hill

Steps:

1) Burning Desire that becomes an obsession.

2) Adopt a Definite Purpose (i.e. goal).  Definiteness Of Purpose
takes on animation, life, and power when backed by Burning Desire.

3) Planning definite ways and means to acquire the desire.

4) Every person who wins in any undertaking must be willing to burn his
ships and cut of all sources of retreat.  Only by so doing can one be
sure of maintaining that state of mind known as a burning desire to
win, essential to success.

(Burn all bridges behind, and stake the ENTIRE FUTURE on the ability
to obtain the desire.)

5) Backing the plan with persistence which does not recognize failure.
This is the determination to stand by that desire until it is realized.

6) Believe in the power of Desire backed by Faith.


Faith
Desire
Specialized Knowledge
Imagination (plan, visualization)
Idea
Persistence

Auto-suggestion (to the subconscious mind), mixed with emotion/feeling.

Six Steps for transmuting Desire to it's material manifestation:

1) Fix in your mind the exact amount of money you desire.  It is not
sufficient merely to say "I want plenty of money."  Be definite as to
the amount (there is a psychological reason why).

2) Determine exactly what you intend to give in return for the money
you desire.  (There is no such reality as 'something for nothing'.)

3) Establish a definite date when ou intend to posses the money you desire.

4) Create a definite plan for carrying out your desire, and begin at
once, whether you are ready or not, to put this plan into action.

5) Write out a clear, concise statement of the amount of money you
intend to acquire, name the time limit for its acuisition, state what
you intend to give in return for the money, and describe clearly the
plan through which you intend to accumulate it.

6) Read your written statement aloud, twice daily, once just before
retiring at night, and once after arising in teh morning.  As you read
the statement, see and feel and believe yourself already in possession
of the money.

Side todos: 

- Align my thinking with those who also were dreams that made it big.

- Transmute my strongest emotions into dreams of a constructive nature.

- Cultivate: hope, faith, courage, tolerance and open-mindedness.

- Put into the subconscious mind via autosuggestion, only positive emotions.

- Repeat the Emil Coue formula:
   "Day by day, in every way, I am getting better and better"

##############################################################################

Points:

- Every failure brings with it the seed of an equivalent success.

- Every adversity brings with it the seed of an equivalent advantage.

- Opportunity often comes in a different form than expected.
  Sometimes it comes disguised in the form of misfortune, or temporary
  defeat.

- Success comes to those who become success conscious.  Failure comes
  to those who indifferently allow themselves to become failure
  conscious.

Chapter 2: Desire

- Desire is the magnetizing force.

- Dreams are the seedlings of reality.

- Nothing is impossible.  

- Our only limitations are those we set up in our own minds.

Chapter 3: Faith

- Any impulse of thought which is repeatedly passed on to the
  subconscious mind is, finally, accepted and acted upon by the
  subconscious mind, which proceeds to translate that impulse into its
  physical equivalent, by the most practical procedure available.

- All thoughts which have been emotionalized (given feeling) and mixed
  with faith, begin immediately to translate themselves into their
  physical equivalent or counterpart.

- Emotion/feeling is the factor that gives thoughts vitality, life and action.

- The subconscious mind will translate into its physical equivalent, a
  thought impulse of a negative or destructive nature, just as readily
  as it will act upon thought impulses of a positive or constructive
  nature.  

- One can decieve the subconscious mind when giving it instructions
  via autosuggestion.  By this method, conduct yourself just as you
  would, if you were already in possession of hte material thing which
  you are demanding, which you call upon your subconscious mind.

- A mind dominated by positive emotions, becomes a favorable abode for
  the state of mind known as faith.  A mind so dominated may, at will,
  give the subconscious mind instructions, which it will accept and
  act upon immediately.  Faith is a state of mind which may be induced
  by autosuggestion.

- Faith is the 'eternal elixir' which gives life, power, and action
  to the impulse of thought.

- Faith is the basis of all 'micracles'.

- Faith is the element, the 'chemical' which, when mixed with prayer,
  gives one direct communication with Infinite Intelligence.

- Every man is what he is, because of the dominating thoughts which he
  permits to occupy his mind.

Chapter 4: Auto-suggestion

- Emotion/feeling is essential to auto-suggestion.

Chapter 5: Specialized knowledge

- Knowledge will not attract money unless it is organized and
  intelligently directed, through practical plans of action, to the
  definite end of accumulation of money.

- Real meaning of the word 'educate'.  'Educate' is derived from the
  latin word 'educo', meaning to educe, to draw out, to Develop From
  Within.

- Any man is educated who knows where to get knowledge when he needs
  it, and how to organize that knowledge into definite plans of
  action.  Through the assistance of his 'Master Mind' group, Henry
  Ford had at his command all the specialed knowldge he needed to
  enable him to become one of the wealthiest men in America.  It was
  not essential that he have this knowledge in his own mind.

- The accumulation of great fortunes calls for POWER, and power is
  acquired thorugh highly organized and intelligently directed
  specialized knowledge, but that knowledge does not, necessarily,
  have to be in the possession of hte man who accumulates the
  fortune.

- Sources of knowledge:
  - One's own experience and education
  - Experience and education availbale through cooperation of others
      (Master mind Alliance)
  - Colleges and Universities.
  - Public libraries.  Internet.
  - Special training courses.  

- As knowledge is acquired, it must be organized and put into use,
  for a definite purpose, through practical plans.  Knowledge has no
  value except that which can be gained from its application toward some
  worthy end.

- If you contemplate taking additional schooling, first determine
   the purpose for which you want the knowledge you are seeking, then
   learn where this particular sort of knowledge can be obtained,
   from reliable sources.

- Both success and failure are largely the results of habit.  

- Truly there is something to the idea that hero-worship is helpful,
  provided one worships a Winner.

- ***Close association with one who refuses to compromise with
  circumstances he does not like, is an asset that can never be
  measured in terms of money.

Chapter 6: Imagination

- The impulse of Desire is given shape, form and Action through the
  aid of the imaginative faculty of the mind.

- Two forms of imagination:

   - Synthetic imagination: Arrangement of old concepts, ideas or
     plans ito new combinations.

   - Creative imagination: Using direct communications with Inifinite
     Intelligence.  It is the faculty thorugh which 'unches' and
     'inspiration' are received.

- Use the imagination to create a plan for transforming the desire to
  it's material manifestation.  Then reduce the plan to writing.  By doing
  that, you have definitively have given concrete form to the
  intangible desire.

- When there's a will, there's a way.

- The story of practically every great fortune starts with the day
  when a creator of ideas and a seller of ideas got together and
  worked in harmony.

   - Carnegie surrounded himself with men who could do all that he
     could not do.  Men who created ideas, and men who put ideas into
     operation.

Chapter 7: Organized Planning

- Build plans:

 a) Ally yourself with a group of as many people as you may need for
 the creation, carrying out of your plan... Making use of the 'Master
 Mind' priciple described in a later chapter.

 b) Before forming the 'Master Mind' alliance, decide what advantages,
 and benefits you may offer the individual members of your group, in
 return for their cooperation.

 c) Meet at least twice a week until you have jointly perfected the
 necessary plan or plans.

 d) Maintain perfect harmony with everyone in the group.  (Very important).


- Keep in mind:

  - Plans must be faultless.

  - You must have the advantage of the experience, education, native
    ability and imagination of other minds.  Cooperation in this
    fasion is required.  You may originate your own plans, either in
    whole or part, but see that those plans are checked and approved
    byteh members of your 'Master Mind' alliance.

  - If the first plan doesn't work, replace it with a new plan.  Keep
    replacing if the next plan does not work, etc.

  - Plans must be practical and workable. 

  - Temporary defeat is not permanent failure.

  - No man is ever whipped until he quits in his own mind.

- A QUITTER NEVER WINS -- AND -- A WINNER NEVER QUITS.
  
  - Put this scentence where you will see it every night before you go
    to sleep and every morning before you go to work.

  - Select members in the 'Master Mind' group who do not take defeat seriously.

- Major attributes of leadership:

  1) Unwavering courage.

  2) Self control.

  3) Keen sense of justice.

  4) Definiteness of decision.  

  5) Definiteness of plans.

       - A successful leader must plan his work, and work his plan.

  6) Habit of doing more than paid for.

  7) Pleasing personality.

  8) Sympathy and understanding.

  9) Mastery of detail.

  10) Willingness to assume full responsibility.

  11) Cooperation.  Leadership calls for power, and power calls for cooperation.

- Major causes of failure in leadership:

  1) Inability organize details.

       - Efficient leadership calls for ability to organize and to
         master details.  No genuine leader is ever 'too busy' to do
         anything which may be required of him in his capacity as
         leader.  When a man, whether he is a leader or follower,
         admits that he is 'too busy' to change his plans, or to give
         attention to any emergency, he admits his inefficiency.  The
         successful leader must be the master of all details connected
         with his position.  That means, of course, that he must
         acquire the habit of relegating details to capable
         lieutenants.

   2) Willingness to render humble service.  

       - Turly great leaders are willing, when occasion demands, to
         perform any sort of labor which they would ask another to
         perform.
  

   3) Expectation of pay for what they 'know' instead of what they do
      with that which they know.


   4) Fear of competition from followers.  

       - The able leader trains understudies to whom he may delegate,
         at will, any of the details of his position.  Only in this
         way may a leader multiply himself and prepare himself to be
         at many places, and give attention to many things at one
         time.  An eternal truth that men receive more pay for their
         ability to get others to perform, than they could possibly
         earn by their own efforts.  An efficient leader may, through
         his knowledge of his job and the magnetism of his
         personality, greatly increase the efficiency of others, and
         induce them to render more service and better service than
         they could render without his aid.

    5) Lack of imagination.

    6) Selfishness.

       - The leader who claims the honor for the work of his followers
         is sure to be met by resentment.  The really great leader
         claims none of the honors.  He is contented to see the
         honors, when there are any, go to his followers, because he
         knows that most men will work harder for commendation and
         recognition than theyw ill for money alone.

    7) Intemperance.

    8) Disloyalty.

       - The leader who is not loyal to his trust, and to his
         associates, those above him and those below him, cannot long
         maintain his leadership.

    9) Emphasis of the 'Authority' of leadership.  

       - The efficient leader leads by encouraging, and not by trying
         to instil fear in the hearts of his followers.

    10) Emphasis of title.

- Look at bookmarked section in this chapter about when and how to
  apply for a position.

  Regarding marketing yourself:

  "QQS" Rating = (Quality) + (Quantity) + (proper Spirit of cooperation/harmony)
               = (perfect salesmanship of service)

  Pleasing conduct/personality is essential.



- Thirty Major Causes of Failure:

  1) Unfavorable hereditary background.
  2) Lack of a well-defined purpose in life.
  3) Lack of ambition to aim above mediocrity.
  4) Insufficient education.  
     Education consists of knowledge effectively and persistently applied.
  5) Lack of self-discipline.  (Self-mastery).
  6) Ill health, due to:
       - Over-eating of foods not conductive to health.
       - Wrong habits of thought; giving expression to negatives.
       - Wrong use of, or over-indulgence in sex.
       - Lack of proper physical exercise.
       - Inadequate supply of fresh air, due to improper breathing.  
  7) Unfavorable environmental influences during childhood.
  8) Procrastination.
  9) Lack of persistence.
  10) Negative personality.
  11) Lack of controlled sexual urge.  
  12) Uncontrolled desire for "something for nothing".  
  13) Lack of a well-defined power of decision.
  14) One or more of the six basic fears.
  15) Wrong selection of a mate in marriage.  This can destroy ambition.
  16) Over-caution or Under-caution.
  17) Wrong selection of associates in business.  
      Pick an employer who is worth emulating.  
  18) Superstition and prejudice.  
      Superstition is a form of fear.  
      Men who succeed keep open minds and are afraid of nothing.
  19) Wrong selection of a vocation.
      Select an occupation into which you can throw yourself wholeheartedly.
  20) Lack of concentration of effort.  
      The "jack-of-all-trades" seldom is good at any.
      Concentrate all your efforts on one definite chief aim.
  21) The habit of indiscriminate spending.  
  22) Lack of enthusiasm.
  23) Intolerance.  
      The person with a "closed" mind on any subject seldom gets ahead.
  24) Intemperance.  
      The most damaging forms of intemperance are connected with
      eating, strong drink, and sexual activities.
  25) Inability to cooperate with others.
  26) Possession of power that was not acquired through self effort.  
  27) Intentional dishonesty.
  28) Egotism and vanity.
      These qualities serve as red lights which warn others to keep away.
  29) Guessing instead of thinking.  
      Aquire facts with which to think accurately.  
      Don't act on opinions created by guesswork or snap-judgements.
  30) Lack of capital.
      You need sufficient reserves of capital to absorb the shock of
      your mistakes, and to carry you over until you have established
      a reputation.


pg. 187
Self-analysis questionaire.  (28 questions).
Book says to do this yearly, and compare progress.

pg. 196
Capital consists not alone of money, but more particularly of highly organized, intelligent groups of people who plan ways and means of using money efficiently for the good of the public, and profitably to themselves.  

pg. 202
There is but one dependable method of accumulating, and legally holding riches, and that is by rendering useful service.  



Chapter 8: Decision

The Mastery of Procrastination


The majority of people who fail to accumulate money sufficient for their needs, are, generally, easily influenced by the "opinions" of others.  

Keep your own counsel.  Take no one into your confidence except the members of your "Master Mind" group, and be very sure in your selection of this group that you choose only those who will be in complete sympathy and harmony with your purpose.  

Genuine wisdom is usually conspicious through modesty and silence.  

"Tell the world what you intend to do, but first show it."
"Deeds, and not words, are what count most."

pg. 213, 214, 215

March 5, 1770
John Hancock, Samuel Adams, called an assembly to eject the British.  It was their definite decision that gave birth to our country.  Thus John Hancock, Samuel Adams, and Richard Henry Lee (of the Providence of Virginia) were the real fathers of our country.

Then in March '72, they initiated organized planning with the other colonies.


September 5, 1774
First Continential Congress meets.
Napoleon Hill says to remember this date; he says it is more important than July 4, 1776.


June 28, [1776?], the original draft of the Declaration of Independence was read before the congress.  


pg. 222
The POWER utilized to form the United States consisted of:
- Desire
- Decision
- Faith
- Persistence
- The Master Mind
- Organized Planning


Those who reach decisions promptly and definitely, know what they want, and generally get it.  The leaders in every walk of life decide quickly, and firmly.  That is the major reason why they are leaders.  

Have Definite Decision.



Chapter 9: Persistence

The Sustained Effort Necessary To Induce Faith.

Persistence is an essential factor in the procedure of transmuting desire into its monetary equivalent.  The basis of persistence is the Power of Will.

The ease with which lack of persistence may be conquered will depend entirely upon the intensity of one's desire.  

The starting point of all achievement is Desire. Keep this constantly in mind.
Weak desires bring weak results.
