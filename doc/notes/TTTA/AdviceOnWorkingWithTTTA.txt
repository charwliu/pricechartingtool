IT SHOULD BE BORNE IN MIND THAT A PREREQUISITE FOR DECODING THE BOOK IS THE VERSION SOLD BY LAMBERT GANN WITH THE ORIGINAL DUST JACKET PLUS KNOWLEDGE OF HOW IT DIFFERS FROM THE ORIGINAL VERSION IN A FEW AREAS AND THIS COULD SAVE UP TO $850-00 THIS CAN BE OBTAINED THROUGH THE INTERNET BY THE SMARTIES . YOU NEED A KJV BIBLE , NO OTHER VERSION WILL DO .YOU NEED BOTH HELIOCENTRIC AND GEOCENTRIC EPHEMERIDES AND 45 YEARS IN WALL STREET FOR MARKET PIVOT POINTS.
I AM CURRENTLY DECODING THE FINAL SECTIONS OF THE BOOK AND HAVE FOUND BEYOND ANY DOUBT THAT YOU DO NOT NEED THE HELP OF ANY BOOKS OR AIDS OTHER THAN THOSE STATED ABOVE. THERE IS ONLY ONE PATH NOT SEVERAL AS SOME THINK AND IN THE FINAL ANALYSIS IF ANYTHING YOU DO OR COME UP WITH RESTS ON ANY INTERPRETATION WHICH ANYBODY CAN CHALLENGE THROW IT OUT BECAUSE IF YOU ARE ON THE RIGHT TRACK YOU WILL TURN UP WITH FIGURES WHICH ARE ACCURATE AND WHICH MAKE SENSE FREE OF SUBJECTIVE INTERPRETATIONS.
SIMPLY BE AWARE THAT GANN AHEAD OF TIME KNEW ALL THE DETAILS OF THE BEAR MARKET AND GIVES YOU THE MAIN PIVOTS YEARS AHEAD OF TIME .
HE GIVES THE BEGINNING AND END DATES AS WELL, AND VARIOUS CYCLES + PLANETARY RULES TO MODULATE THE CYCLES + ANCHOR POINTS IN THE FUTURE FOR REFLECTING DATES OF EVENTS AHEAD OF TIME . I WISH TO SAY THAT MANY GURUS INTRODUCE ELEMENTS AND KNOWLEDGE AIMED AT PRODUCING AWE AND HELPLESSNESS IN SEARCHERS AND THIS IS MISCHIEVOUS SO BEWARE ONE SUCH EXAMPLE WITH LOGICAL INCONSISTENCIES IS THE ARTICLE " THE GREAT PYRAMID IS THE BIBLE IN STONE ". FINALLY THE HIGHLY PUBLICISED AND CIRCULATED VIDEO ON TTTA IS HIGHLY MISLEADING AND ALL WRONG.

Subject: Re: [wheelsinthesky] what to think about this....


Indeed this is a stimulating exchange of views and I wish to take it from first principles .  I am not an intraday trader and prefer to trade unleveraged instruments as this suits my mind best .  In my opinion the 3 best authors are Brad Cowan , Dan Ferrera , and Michael Jenkins and the fourth would be Earik Bean of course .

As far as Gann is concerned, all of us here want to decode his writings above anything else, as he is the only one who demonstrated an ability to forecast market turning points to the day years ahead . And his knowledge of cycles dwarfs the rest who have not demonstrated such a capability in a book like Tunnel .

From my work it is evident that hard work and detailed observation is needed far above fantasy and self indulgent interpretations and subjective interpretations not backed quantitatively . Success with Gann requires methodical and systematic precise and goal directed work and not intellectual self indulgence and fantasy . Those who make the necessary breakthroughs will find that he very generously puts in hints and facts in different places for you to crosscheck and confirm that what you got is right and that you are on the right track. It simply requires humility and a knowledge of how to formulate hypotheses , analyze cause and effect and proceed by elimination .

Best of Luck,
Serge

Hello Rick,

Have you listen to Bonnie tape TTA...

Bonnie is right...I had initially "imagined" that Robert, Mary,...etc
Mars, Venus,..etc but I found I was wrong and she is right.

Take all the dates, Numbers,and throw the rest in the garbage then
subcategorize the dates into Financial Astrology, Personal Astrology,
Mundane Astrology and STUDY all the dates as per Bonnie instructions
in the tape...that is the best way to learn Gann hidden info in TTA...

There is a "key" you must find in the bible..there is ONE number in
the TTA and ONE sign in the bible both are the same when you put them
together you will unlock "entire" code for all the numbers mentioned
in TTA, the order of these numbers are very important..TTA gives the
right date for all the major cycles..

Regards,

Haytham
