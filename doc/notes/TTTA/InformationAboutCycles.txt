He had figured out from the Bible that a time of
trouble such as the world had never seen would begin in
1927, and would continue until 1932. There would be
war, famine and pestilence all over the earth, and that
except the time be shortened every human being on the
face of the earth would be destroyed according to the
Bible.

pg. 50-61
Gann quotes Ezekiel and makes connections to the war.  

pg. 69, 70.  
Read these pages carefully.

pg. 72.
Please read Ezekiel very carefully,
for I believe that Ezekiel is the greatest of all prophets.
He aptly describes an airplane which I can make that will be
a great aid in time of war. I believe that Ezekiel plainly
foretold the war yet to come which will be fought in the air.

pg. 73-74.
The noisome beast referred to [in Ezekiel] is the airplane. If we make
calculations from the date and place of birth, I think we can
determine what our future is to be, and in this way live according to
cause and effect, which is God's divine law.

Article on Cycles.  
I need to find the astrological cycles that make up the cycles given here.

There are cycles running through TTTA, so see if I can find these cycles in TTTA (page numbers).  Certain number of years = certain number of pages?.  Think on this.  There is a relation between pg. 9 and pg. 79, which is a difference of 70.  Looking on page 70, there is mention about time factors.  


pg. 85-89.
Article on Transportation Cycles.

rluu: Places in TTTA that reference Ezekiel (or Ezekiel's airplane or war in the air), are probably references to the cycle described by Ezekiel.
