Notes, thoughts, and ideas on the Jonah cycle and puzzles in TTTA.

Notes added 20130711:

One of the things I realized is that the Bible is probably using Babylonian astrology techniques.  And so in my study of Babylonian, Sumerian, Assyrian, (Middle East) history, astronomy/calendars, and religion/holidays/rituals, I found that they counted quarters of the synodic lunar months by 7.  They did it in the following way:

7 days   = first  quarter lunation.
7 days   = second quarter lunation.
7 days   = third  quarter lunation.
8-9 days = fourth quarter lunation.

Total: 30 days or phases of the lunar month.

This is a clue that they used 7 as a number to indicate a quarter of a lunar month.

They held the 19th day as sacred, which would be:
30 + 19 = 49.

For the 17th of Tammuz:
30 + 30 + 17 (of Tammuz) = 77

Part of the St. John and Jonah mystery is in TTTA on page 130.

On page 130 of TTTA, highlighted is verse 11 of chapter 21 to find:
153 fishes

Page 131 highlights the 33 words at the end.  
Perhaps this is 3 days and 3 nights?

Looking at the dates celebrated by St. John (per the Tridentine Calendar):
Feast day (commemorated as "John, Apostle and Evangelist"): December 27
Octave (from feast day up to and including): January 3
Feast of St. John before the Latin Gate:  May 6

So time periods between each are:
7 + 123 = 130 days total.


Note: 130 is the total, and this information about St. John is highlighted in TTTA on page 130.  Also in Bayer's "Turn 400 Years...", he starts his part 3 of the book on page 130.  So we have a confluence of the importance of the number 130.  What does this number refer to?  And how is it used?

Feast of "St John before the Latin Gate", associated with a tradition recounted by Saint Jerome that St John was brought to Rome during the reign of the Emperor Domitian, and was thrown in a vat of boiling oil, from which he was miraculously preserved unharmed.


Other time periods for St. John:
Nativity of St. John: June 24
Octave of St. John the baptist, from nativity to: July 1.
Beheading of St. John, feast: August 29.

Time period difference between Nativity and Beheading: 66 days


Attributes of Apostle and St. John: 
Book, a serpent in a chalice, cauldron, eagle.



The Eastern Orthodox Church and those Eastern Catholic Churches which follow the Byzantine Rite commemorate the "Repose of the Holy Apostle and Evangelist John the Theologian" on September 26. On May 8 they celebrate the "Feast of the Holy Apostle and Evangelist John the Theologian", on which date Christians used to draw forth from his grave fine ashes which were believed to be effective for healing the sick.

"Repose of the Holy Apostle and Evangelist John the Theologian": Sept. 26
"Feast of the Holy Apostle and Evangelist John the Theologian": May 8

Difference in time period: 224 days

In the above, it does appear that 123 could be an approximation for the angle mentioned in the book of Jonah.  

In Jonah, it is mentioned "more than 120,000", so the angle is greater than 120 degrees.  This is emphasized by Allan Blakstad also.  

In TTTA pg. 130, the number 2.75 is given.  If added to 120, then it would give:
122.75 degrees.

Multiplying this value by 4 would yield: 491, which is 1940 backwards, per the title of TTTA.  Note that this is something hinted at because 11 and 2.75 is mentioned in the text of TTTA on pg. 130.  

So the actual angle for Jonah is highly likely to be 122.75.
