When I did a google search for this word, I couldn't find it as an actual word, but found a reference to it in book:

Creative abundance. The psychology of ability and plenty ([c1921])
by Ruggles, Bernard C

Notice the copyright date of 1921, which would be a number of years before the writing of TTTA.

Mention of the word 'peptomist' and what it means can be found on page 27 of that book.

Here is the OCR text of those the pages from archive.org:


CHAPTER THREE 

IF I should write the two words, pep and opti- 
mism, upon a blackboard, you would see how 
they can be fused into one new word, "pepto- 
mism." So you understand that peptomism 
means putting "pep" into optimism. There is 
no more vital word for our times than this new one which 
has been coined. It covers a world of possible ability and 
power. 

Optimism is a much misused word. It has lost its 
virility through association with the wrong sort of people. 
Any Sunny Jim can pass for an optimist. We only ask for 
a two-cent grin and we call it optimism. But the original 
force of the word must be retained. We redeem it when 
we make it mean something big, brave and hopeful. We 
give it vitality and lift it into dignity and worth. Better 
still, we add "pep" to it and let it have a new and larger use. 
Peptomism is a word with a wealth of meaning. It is 
not enough to know the derivation of a word. Its scope and 
its potentialities are most important. Here you will find 
the psychology of the right attitude to your work and the 
way to increase your powers of enjoyment and achievement. 
This will enlarge your consciousness and give you a diviner 
perspective. Things can no longer look small, mean or 
contemptible in your scope of action. 

What you are and do is qualified by your mental atti- 
tude. When you change your viewpoint, get a new slant 
on things which you constantly face, life takes on a more 
joyous aspect. When you look at a Cubist or Futurist 
painting, you wonder how on earth any one could see 
things that way. Well, they do, and artists assure us the

picture is the result of a certain angle of vision. That is 
what peptomism does for you — it gives you a new mental 
angle and a spiritual vision to meet your world and your 
work in a larger way. 

1. A peptomist is one who not only sees a bright side 
but cheerfully rolls up his sleeves and gets busy helping 
God to bring a brighter day. Your social pessimist will 
tell you what a mess the world is in He is worried, learn- 
edly worried. But a peptomist will courageously meet the 
trying ordeals and work until he sees improvement come 
smiling through. He senses God at work in the scheme of 
things and so lends his best skill as a co-laborer with God. 

I have faith that we will wobble along. I do not believe 
with a University of Chicago professor that "our demented 
world may have no future." The world is not crazy — it is 
only groping in a dim mental condition. The mass mind is 
dazed and hazy as yet. But the world is to have a future, 
a nobler future. Every crisis always brings a full crop of 
wise pessimists. Better an inane optimism than a hopeless 
pessimism. Better still to feed a budding hopefulness which 
stirs one to get busy and better the little world in which 
one lives. That is the first step toward peptomism. 

So I am going to take the gravity of things in our world 
as a peptomist. I will start with faith, courage, wisdom and 
a soul-deep smile. I will put myself in the Divine Work- 
shop and be about the All-Father's business of bettering 
the world. Chiefly that bettering will go on inside of me. 
Since that is God's Workshop, I am helping Him, as I am 
"a workman that needeth not be ashamed, handling skill- 
fully the Truth of Life," which is, that good is, because God 
is. I shall laugh and sing as I work and plan I shall 
encourage and cheer as I lift and redeem. I shall keep 
bright and sweet as I face hard problems and grave situa- 
tions. Then I will be a peptomist, at work with God; 



CREATIVE ABUNDANCE 29 

serene, hopeful and constructive, building in thought and 
dream, the Kingdom of The Better Day. 

I will become a divine asset when I do this. And he 
who is valuable to God is thrice so to man. So it pays to 
be a peptomist. It gives you a healthy-minded attitude to 
the world and it furnishes you with greater creative powers 
to bless life. A world without a goal of increasing good- 
ness will never give you comfort, peace or joy. Unless I 
knew that the world would wag on and right itself, just as it 
has done before, I would not dare to smile. But it will 
come right and I have a cheerful desire to help God to 
harmonize it. And just this spirit will put the sinews into 
me for any aspect of life. I shall not worry about the world. 
If there is any to be done, I will leave it to the Creator. 
He made it and He knows how it will end. He called it 
good to start with and His last word will be the same. He 
has the plans. Therefore I shall laugh and love and lift. 
And that is what peptomism means to you in any dark hour 
of the world's life.
