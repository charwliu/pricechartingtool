But, Robert, when Marie returns to you in all her beauty, I am sure that you will not act in the way that Pygmalion did, when he caused Galatea to pray to the Grecian Gods to turn her back to cold marble again.  I am sure, yes, I know, that such devotion as yours will keep Marie always when she returns to you."
