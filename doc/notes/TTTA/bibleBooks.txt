Information about Bible books referenced in TTTA. 

I believe Gann is telling us to read these books because they are important.

##############################################################################

rluu:  When Gann says to read everything in the Bible that he could find related to 'Love' or any other word/topic, I believe Gann wants us to do the same in TTTA.  This is to find connections. 

rluu: What does it mean when the same bible quote (or bible quote references) shows up in multiple places in TTTA?  That those events or pages are connected?

Summary:

Books referenced, and my thoughts.

Book of Daniel:  
Daniel was a great prophet and astrologer, and many cycles are given.  Gann quotes from Daniel, and says to especially read Daniel's prophecies.  I will need to know the tribes.  I need to know this book really well (time periods, etc.).

Book of Revelation:
Gives prophecy about the Great War (by St. John) and other predictions.  It may just be a section of predictions, and not predictive methods.  This book says that Satan is bound for a thousand years (is Satan a planet?).  This book has some time periods too (1260 days), so perhaps it is exploring.

Story of Job (Is this the Book of Job, in it, or a story somewhere else?):
Referenced in TTTA a few times related to love, hope, fear, faith, etc.
I need to know this story at the very least.  Perhaps I should just read it too.

Book of Ezekiel:
About the technicals of numbers, time, and cycles.  
Gann quotes from the book prolifically.  
I need to know this book inside and out.

Book of Jonah:
Gann says to read this book very carefully. (pg. 69)

Genesis?:
Reference to Enoch, related to the 5000 year cycle (pg. 85).
Reference to Noah, in Ezekiel (pg. 73).

Book of Solomon (Songs, or Song of Solomon):
Related to love (pg. 170).  
Gann says to read every chapter of this book (pg. 212).

Ezekiel 14: 14, 16, 18 and 21 references Noah, Daniel and Job.   (pg. 73)
I'm not sure where else Noah is written about besides his Ark in Genesis.

Searching for the word 'book' yields the following.


pg. 7

He would sit for hours, listening to his mother
read the Bible, from the Book of Revelation, the prophecies
of the Great War, where it says that nation shall
rise against nation.

pg. 13

He would sit for hours, listening to his mother
read the Bible, from the Book of Revelation, the prophecies
of the Great War, where it says that nation shall
rise against nation.


pg. 26

He read the Bible, especially the story of Job, continued to go to church, and while he was suffering many trials and tribulations, his mind was expanding.

pg. 35

Robert received Marie’s letter, he began
to see himself in a different light. He read
again the Book of Job, and realized what Job meant
when he said, "I had a great fear, and it has come upon
me." Robert realized that he had been fearful of losing
Marie, and that as soon as there seemed to be a possibility
of someone else being attracted to her, that that fear
had come upon him and caused him to become jealous
without cause, and that he had lost or was about to lose,
Marie, who had been more than life to him.


pg. 41

After Robert returned, he began to study the Bible
more than ever, and work out things according to
science. He read the Book of Ezekiel, and planned on
building an airplane along the lines outlined by Ezekiel.
Figured that there must be a way to build a plane of
this kind which would be the greatest ever, and felt that
the day was coming when his country would need the
protection of the greatest invention of the age. From
reading of the Bible, war seemed inevitable, and Robert
believed that the next war would be in the air.
He began to read all the magazines along the lines of
science and invention and studied the Bible in order to
understand natural law and know how to apply it.


pg. 69

I have read the Book of Jonah thru very carefully, and I
believe that I understand what the Saviour meant when he
said:
"No sign shall be given, but the sign of the prophet
Jonas."


pg. 81

The proof that it is possible to make predictions of
wars, famines, pestilences and general world events
thousands of years in advance, is plainly substantiated
by the Bible. The great World War was prophesied
in the Book of Revelation.
What proof do we find in the Bible of what events
or conditions will follow wars? What does the Bible
say of the great World War which St. John the Divine
foretold in the Book of Revelation?
"For nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom
against kingdom; and there shall be famines, and pestilences,
and earthquakes in divers places."


pg. 85

The Bible tells us that Enoch, who
was the seventh from Adam -- a number generally referred
to as divine -- was translated to heaven for his
faith at the age of 365 years. This event took place
about 3017 B.c. I believe that at that time they had
all modern inventions and that Enoch went up in an
airplane. The writer of the book, probably not having
seen an airplane before and seeing Enoch go into the
sky, thought that he had gone to heaven. We are now
in the 5000-year cycle, from the time that Enoch was
transferred to heaven, and this indicates the progress
of the airplane at this time. Elijah was also translated
to heaven in a cloud of fire, in 896 B.C. I believe this,
too, was an airplane. Since the chariot was seen blazing
with some kind of fire or gas, the recorder thought it
was just something to take Elijah to heaven.

pg. 294

It was indeed a time of trouble such as the world
has never known, as spoken of by St. John in the Book
of Revelation.

pg. 378

Supreme Commander Gordon told the President
to read the Bible, especially Daniel's prophecy and the
book of Ezekiel, and he would know what was yet to
take place.

Searching for each book name, individually, yields the following.


pg. 33

This is to be my farewell letter to you. I quote from Solomon,
2: 5, "Stay me with flagons, comfort me with apples;
for I am sick of love." Robert, I would rather have green
apples and a stomach-ache, like Solomon says, for I am sick
of what you call love. I want you to read St. Paul again,
and see if the way you are acting is the way love acts. Paul
says that "Love suffereth long, and is kind; love envieth not,
doth not behave itself unseemly, seeketh not her own, is not
easily provoked, thinketh no evil." Robert, if love is founded
on faith and trust, it cannot be jealous. Love is the foundation
of understanding, and if you understood me and if I
thoroughly understood you, we would be in love yet, and
be happy.

pg. 170

Robert read everything in the Bible that he could find
on love. At last he read the song of Solomon.
Robert knew that he would never leave his first love
and go back on her, that that was the one love of his
life and that it would remain so long as there was life
in his body. With this resolve in his heart he decided
to face the future with hope.

pg. 212

ROBERT turned to the Bible for consolation. Read
every chapter of the Song of Solomon. Was very
much impressed with Chapter 2: 14:


pg. 41

He read the Book of Ezekiel, and planned on
building an airplane along the lines outlined by Ezekiel.
Figured that there must be a way to build a plane of
this kind which would be the greatest ever, and felt that
the day was coming when his country would need the
protection of the greatest invention of the age. From
reading of the Bible, war seemed inevitable, and Robert
believed that the next war would be in the air.

pg. 72

My great desire to make money, I want you to understand,
is to do some good with it and benefit my country, when she
will need the benefit most. Please read Ezekiel very carefully,
for I believe that Ezekiel is the greatest of all prophets.
He aptly describes an airplane which I can make that will be
a great aid in time of war. I believe that Ezekiel plainly
foretold the war yet to come which will be fought in the air,

pg. 99

Robert told his mother of his plans. That he expected
within a few months to go to New York, establish
himself there, and speculate in order to make money
so that he could build his great airplane according to
Ezekiel's plan and prepare to help his country in time
of war. Mrs. Gordon was very happy to learn of her
boy's success. She was sad when he began to talk about
war. Robert assured her that the Bible plainly foretold
the great war which was to be fought in the air and
that it was his duty to help protect his country.


pg. 67

I have demonstrated this to mean that the planets rule our
destinies. It is right for us to understand them as Daniel did
and interpret the secret and hidden things.

pg. 74

Daniel was known to be a great prophet and astrologer. In
his prophecies, he foretold war, pestilence and famine to come
upon this earth, and by a proper study of the repetition of
cycles we can determine the time when important events will
take place in the future.

pg. 213

Robert believed that he understood the cycle and knew
the number of years, months and days referred to in
Daniel’s prophecies. Calculated that from March, 1931,
until the end of June, 1932, would be troublesome times
for the United States. Depression, war and panic would
hang over the destinies of his country. Robert had gone
deeply into the Bible study in order to learn more about
the great science of Astrology. From the Bible he
interpreted that he belonged to the tribe of Issachar, the
fifth son of Jacob and that this name indicated price,
reward, recompense. He understood from this that he
would have to pay the price, but he would receive the
reward for his faithfulness and devotion to Marie.


pg. 327

I believe the prophecy of Daniel which has often been referred
to by Colonel Gordon, Chap. 7: 27, “And kingdom
and dominion, and the greatness of kingdom under the
whole heaven, shall be given to the people of the saints of the
Most High, whose kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, and all
dominions shall serve and obey him.” I believe that refers to
the United States. If we can win this war, then as we are
one against the world, it shall be a kingdom of the United
World. In my judgment it would be wise to place Colonel
Robert Gordon in supreme command and follow his instructions
to the letter.


pg. 370

He then wondered when the war would end. He
knew that Daniel's 70 weeks indicated the end in 1932,
or about 3 1/2 years from the time that war first broke
out in Europe in 1928. He read Daniel 7: 12: "As
concerning the rest of the beasts, they had their dominion
taken away: yet their lives were prolonged for a
season and time." And again the 25th verse: "And
he shall speak great words against the Most High, and
shall wear out the saints of the Most High, and think
to change times and laws; and they shall be given into
his hand, until a time and times and the dividing of
time." He had proved by study and comparing past
cycles that a time or a season referred to in the Bible
meant 360 days, 360 years, or 360 degrees, -- a measure
known and used by the astrologers in olden times and
still understood and used by modern astrologers for
measuring time. He knew that half a time meant
180 degrees, 180 days or years, because Ezekiel had said
that the Lord had appointed a day for a year. He
figured that America began with the discovery by Columbus
in 1492 and that in October, 1932, would be
440 years since the discovery. The measurement used
thruout the Bible was by scores and man's span of
life was three score years and ten, and that four hundred
and forty years equalled twenty-two scores, leaving
two scores, or forty years, more for the completion
of the jubilee years. He read Matthew 18: 21 and 22:
"Then came Peter to him, and said, Lord, how oft shall
my brother sin against me, and I forgive him? till
seven times? Jesus saith unto him, I say not unto
thee, Until seven times; but, Until seventy times seven."
Robert figured that seventy times seven meant four
hundred and ninety years from the discovery of America
until we would cease fighting, forgive our brothers
and live in peace. He knew that the seventh period
was always a jubilee period, that there was a jubilee
period of seven years at the end of each forty-ninth
year period and that there was a great period of fortynine
jubilee years at the end of seven times seventy;
that the sixth period would end in 1933 and that from
1933 to 1982 would be the forty-nine years of the great
jubilee following the end of wars and the United Kingdom
of the World.


pg. 378

Supreme Commander Gordon told the President
to read the Bible, especially Daniel's prophecy and the
book of Ezekiel, and he would know what was yet to
take place. It was agreed that the news of the success
with the "Demon of Death" and the sleeping gas machine
was to be kept secret and that the President was
the only one to know of Robert's great invention.


pg. 69

I have read the Book of Jonah thru very carefully, and I
believe that I understand what the Saviour meant when he
said:
"No sign shall be given, but the sign of the prophet
Jonas."


pg. 7

He would sit for hours, listening to his mother
read the Bible, from the Book of Revelation, the prophecies
of the Great War, where it says that nation shall
rise against nation.


pg. 8

“My son, war is the work of the devil, not of God,
and the Bible tells us that the old dragon has to be loosed
for a little season, but in the Book of Revelation, we
read that Satan is bound for a thousand years. I hope
I live to see that day and I feel sure you will.

pg. 81


The proof that it is possible to make predictions of
wars, famines, pestilences and general world events
thousands of years in advance, is plainly substantiated
by the Bible. The great World War was prophesied
in the Book of Revelation.
What proof do we find in the Bible of what events
or conditions will follow wars? What does the Bible
say of the great World War which St. John the Divine
foretold in the Book of Revelation?


pg. 294

The waters in the bay had
been poisoned and the fish were dying from this deadly
gas. It was indeed a time of trouble such as the world
has never known, as spoken of by St. John in the Book
of Revelation.


pg. 73

"Though these three men, Noah, Daniel and Job, were
in it, they should deliver but their own souls by their
righteousness, saith the Lord God."
"Though these three men were in it, as I live, saith the
Lord God, they shall deliver neither sons nor daughters;
they only shall be delivered, but the land shall
be desolate."
