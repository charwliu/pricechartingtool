Bibles quotes from TTTA.

I started compiling the quotes.  This is not complete.  I realized it may not make sense to compile them all in this way, since one must be very fluent with the story line in TTTA and how it relates to the bible quote before it has any use.  Thus, I may just have to read TTTA many times and get used to assicating the Bible quote to the part of the story.

rluu 20120508:
According to WITS post #6630, bible quotes are connections to other parts of TTTA.  I believe I have read about this technique used by Gann somewhere else as well (another WITS post?).  It is probably still worth going through and finding all the quotes to compare with what is actually written in the Bible.  Another poster (I can't remember who) says that there are small differences in the TTTA bible quotes and the actual text from the Bible.

Ch. 1, pg. 3
1 Thes. 4:16-18

{4:16} For the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel, and with the trump of God: and the dead in Christ shall rise first: {4:17} Then we which are alive [and] remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air: and so shall we ever be with the Lord. {4:18} Wherefore comfort one another with these words.


From TTTA:

Robert was very much interested in this sermon, and
asked his mother to explain how the Lord could descend
from Heaven and what kind of vehicle we would ride
in if we were caught up in the clouds to meet the Lord
in the air. His mind puzzled over this for weeks and
months, and he was anxious to understand more about
it. He said, "Mother, I should like to meet the Lord
in the air.”
His mother said, “You will be able to do so some
day, Bobbie.”

Ch. 1, pg. 3
2 Thes. 1:7-8

{1:7} And to you who are troubled rest with us, when the Lord Jesus shall be revealed from heaven with his mighty angels, {1:8} In flaming fire taking vengeance on them that know not God, and that obey not the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ.

From TTTA:

The preacher
said that the Lord had placed the rainbow in the sky
as a testimony that he would never again destroy the
world by water, but explained that God would come
again in a flame of fire and thus take vengeance on
those who did not believe and destroy the world by fire.
Robert wanted to know if the good Lord who loves us
so much would destroy the world and all of those in
it. His mother explained that God would destroy those
that were sinners and rebelled against him and had not
accepted his word.

Ch. 1, pg. 4
1 Tim. 2:11-14

{2:11} Let the woman learn in silence with all subjection. {2:12} But I suffer not a woman to teach, nor to usurp authority over the man, but to be in silence. {2:13} For Adam was first formed, then Eve. {2:14} And Adam was not deceived, but the woman being deceived was in the transgression. 

From TTTA:

He asked the
Sunday School teacher to explain what this meant, -- by
learning in silence and subjection. He also wanted an
explanation of the statement that a woman should not
teach, because he said that his mother had always taught
him and loved him, and his father had paid no attention
to him and had no desire to teach him. He wanted
to know if it was wrong for his mother to teach him,
and if God would punish her. The teacher replied that
the Lord said, “Suffer the little children to come unto
me, and forbid them not, for of such is the Kingdom
of God.” She explained that his mother set an example
more by her love and devotion than by words; that a
mother's actions would influence a child more than anything
she could say, and this was the great silent
teaching.

Note:
The quote by the Sunday School teacher, used to explain the previous bible quote is from: Mark 10:14.  See below.

{10:14} But when Jesus saw [it,] he was much displeased, and said unto them, Suffer the little children to come unto me, and forbid them not: for of such is the kingdom of God.

Ch. 1, pg. 5
Gen. 1:7 is referenced, but is a mis-quote.
Quote is from 2 Tim 1:7.

{1:7} For God hath not given us the spirit of fear; but of power, and of love, and of a sound mind.

From TTTA:

When Robert heard
this, he wanted to know how it was that we should fear
things, if God had not given us the spirit of fear nor
created the spirit of fear in us, but gave us a spirit of
power and of love and of sound mind. His mother
explained to him that the ghost and the fear of the dark
which the old darkies told him about, were nothing but
superstition, and he should banish it from his mind.

Ch. 1, pg. 5
2 Tim. 3:1

{3:1} This know also, that in the last days perilous times shall come. 

From TTTA:

Robert was anxious to know
when the last days would come. His mother told him
it would be at the time of the end of the world and God
would again come to destroy the world by fire.

####################

Ch. 1, pg. 5
2 Tim. 3:15

{3:15} And that from a child thou hast known the holy scriptures, which are able to make thee wise unto salvation through faith which is in Christ Jesus. 

From TTTA:

Robert was
desirous of knowing if children could teach more about
the scriptures than grown people. His mother told him
that the Bible said, “A little child shall lead them,”
and that anyone who would harm little children, can
in no wise enter into the Kingdom of Heaven.

Note: 
In the above, Robert's mother quotes from Isaiah 11:6.
