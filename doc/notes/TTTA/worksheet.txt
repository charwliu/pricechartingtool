Page numbers:

- Add all digits of that are in the page number. 
- Page number with the number 7.  (for age or length of a cycle).
- Page number with decimal place shifted.
- Difference between page numbers that have a connection (referencing the subject or topic).
- Reflecting that many pages again from two pages that have a connection.
- Page number anagram: try looking at other pages that have the same numbers in the page number.  

Pages:

- Count the number of times that a particular word is mentioned on a page, and consecutive pages.  The starting page where this occurance happens may be important.  (e.g. "love" showing up 37 times on pages 33 and 34, "faith" on pg. 211).

Words:

- Any word that follows the word "great" or "greatest" is an important word that means something special.
- What words are capitalized?  Are there any words that stand out as being peculiar in usage?
- First letter of each capitalized word as a number (numerology).
- Are there any italicized words?
- Are there any words that are differently typeset?
- Are the words "and" and "or" used?  Add or multiply the number of letters in those words.
- Count the words within a poem or letter.  The word number could be associated with the word.  (e.g. Marie's letter on pg. 120, or Marie's telegraph on pg. 38).
- The Bible words and terms don't use english/pythagorean numerology, but Gann explains what they mean somewhere in TTTA.

Locations:
- Pay attention to locations written on the letters.

Numbers:

- Numbers in written form.
- Numbers on the page.  
- Money values give numbers.
- Bible verses give numbers:
  - Take segments of the numbers shown to see a number.
  - Add the Bible verse numbers to see a number.

Lines:

- Line number of the page.
- Line number of a poem.  (Haven't seen this done in a letter yet).
- Numbering of verses/stanzas in a poem.

Sentences:

- Do any sentences in a paragraph seem not to fit?
- Do any of the sentences read funny?
- Does it seem like he is using funny phrasing in a round-about way?

Quotes:

- Count the number of words in a quote.
- Count the number of letters in a quote.
- Quotes may relate to other quotes around the same page/area (in terms of numbers of words and letters).  

Chapter:

- What chapter are we in?  It seems like Gann used themes within certain chapters.
- Where does it fit in in terms of the book story line?  (and cycle structure in general).
