Mission Statement


I intend to be a profitable trader, earning enough money to support myself financially, by the date October 25, 2012.  The amount of money earned will be in accordance with my maturity level with money.  This means the amount of money is connected to my knowledge of how to use it responsibly and virtuously for the benefit of all, to my ability to use it effectively, and to my understanding of money's inherent natures and tendencies.  

In acquiring this money and knowledge, I would like to keep in mind that happiness is more abundant when money and knowledge is shared with others that have a mutual connection, especially over a shared experience.  Thus, regarding money and knowledge related to trading and the universal laws, these things should be shared in whatever amounts is appropriate for the current time, place, and people involved.  In deciding the matters of how much to share and who to share it with, I will use my best judgment, consulting the I Ching as necessary.
