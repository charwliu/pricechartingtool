Hi folks,

I feel like elaborating a little on the fishy side of Gann:

I have been troubled with the Cetus story that was introduced by some
authorities. Cetus was more like a sea monster and not the kind of
fish you would survive three days and nights in as a stomachial guest
of honor. Cetus is lying south of the ecliptic, well enough, but you
have to go a long way back (precession-wise) in order to find a match-
up with Christmas. These days the sun passes it after the equinox.

In some biblical lessons I have, the fish in Jonah is linked to the
Dagon of the Babylonians. The celestial version of this is the
Piscis Austrinus. This is a much kinder fish, it's the one drinking
from Aquarius' bottle. The PA is lying further south than Cetus, but
it is placed at 21-23 hrs RA. This means that the Sun is in its area
the last three hours (of 15 degrees) before crossing the ecliptic at
spring equinox.

The Cetus is a Greek fish monster and it is not very likely that this
story is found in a Hebrew bible. The Assyrian link is more credible.

Just wanted to pass it along.

Petter.

Hi Phil,

I know that your comment is the accepted consensus by theologians and some
historians. BUT, it is the astro Jesus we are studying, not the historical
one. They are not the same! The Phoenician YES (Bacchus) that became the
Roman JES-US is the sun.

If you concentrate on the solstices and equinoxes and leave the (not-so-real
if you ask me) historical Jesus out of the equation, I believe it will
facilitate our learning process!

Heretically yours,
Petter.

Hi Joe,
When referring to the Astro(nomical) Jesus (and also Tunnel Jesus) I mean the sun!
Petter.
