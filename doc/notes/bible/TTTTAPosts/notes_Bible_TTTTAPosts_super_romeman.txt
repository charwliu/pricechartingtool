Title: Re: Bible Encyclopaedia
I believe that "The Interpreter's Dictionary of the Bible" is still
considered to be the most authoratative source by far. I am not
Stateside, so I don't have access to it at the moment, but if I
remember correctly and if it has not been further updated, it
consists of four (hefty) volumes, together with a supplemental volume.

Besides dictionaries, there are also Bible commentaries. These may be
single-volume books dealing with the whole Bible (Peake's Commentary
is a good one) or they may be books that deal with each book of the
Bible separately. (I am anxious to see a variety of commentaries on
Ezekiel when I next go to the States.)

There are some works on line, but they are all books that are in the
public domain, I believe. Most were written decades, if not a century
or more, ago. We have made a number of archeological and textual
discoveries since they were written.

That said, you can check out some items for free at these sites.
First of all, you will want a good Bible.

http://bible.gospelcom.net/ [I love this site. You can go to any part
of the Bible immediately by putting in the book and chapter (and
verse, if you want) in the lefthand box. On the righthand box, you
can input words you want to find, so it acts as a concordance, too.
In addition, you have a choice of translations. The "authorized
version" used by Gann is the "King James Version." This is written in
Shakespearean English, however, and also we have found more
manuscripts in the last 400 years, so we also have better
translations available now. I think the New International Version is
an outstanding translation of the Bible into today's English -- just
as the King James translation was an outstanding translation into the
English of the times. The NIV can be, and has been criticized, but it
has won my loyalty nonetheless.]

On-line research may be done here:

http://bible.crosswalk.com/

http://www.studylight.org/

http://www.textweek.com/ [very cool site, once you learn to negotiate
it; has a lot of bibliographies to recent scholarship on the Bible]

http://www.blueletterbible.org/

http://www.eliyah.com/lexicon.html [Strong's, although an old book,
is very authoratative]

http://www.hivolda.no/asf/kkf/biblia01.html

THERE IS AN IMPORTANT CAVEAT:

When you're dealing with Gann quoting the Bible, you have to know
what you are looking for. His use and interpretation of the Bible
clearly come from esoteric and metaphysical sources, who make an at-
times rather fanciful interpretation of the Bible. Definitely do NOT
assume that when Gann quotes a Scripture, he is using it in a
traditional way.

There is a truckload of stuff on the web about astrology in the
Bible. Some works that you can download for further study are:

http://lettere.unipv.it/SETH/calendar.htm [site is partly in Italian;
grab Lester Ness's "Astrology and Judaism in Late Antiquity."]

http://philologos.org/downloads/downloads.htm [download
Bullinger's "Witness of the Stars," on Gann's recommended reading
list, and also the earlier work by Frances Rolleston "Mazzaroth or
the Constellations."]

this should keep you busy for a while.

Title: Professor O.B. Joyful
What was one of Gann's messages? My opinion is the mentioning of the
Royal Arch Degree of Freemasonry. Upon attaining the Royal Arch
Degree, the "LOST WORD" is revealed as "JaoBulOn" which is made up of
three words "Jao" which is Greek for "Jehovah", "Bul" the rendering
of "Baal" and "On" for "Osiris".

The secret ritual book of the Freemasonry in inscribed with the
initials "J.B.O."

Now Professor Joyful's office is described as "to receive those in
love" and the lost word is revealed "in peace, love and unity".

Additionally when one reaches the Royal Arch Degree, it "is the
consummation of the Master Mason Degree. It is here that a mason
discovers how to collect his wages and most importantly finds that
which was lost - the Master's Word." TTTA page 178 "He told Robert
that he born a genius and in the next few years would make a great
success in speculation and in the field of aviation." Here he is
told of how he will collect his wages - field of speculation and
field of aviation.

Why would Gann reverse the initials in rendering the Professor's name
to those of the "secret ritual book"?

At times I wonder whether Gann wrote the book for the general
populace or for passing the veiled message to other masons.

As Gann writes on page 25 Robert was "a willing worker, an expert
stenographer and secretary". Stenographer is a synonym
for "crypotgrapher" and it is duly noted that in
freemasonry "ciphering" was used to convery "veiled messages" to
those who could interpret them.

Gerry

I forgot to mention, for what it is worth, that the city of
heliopolis is ...

ON.

As "On," Heliopolis is mentioned in the Bible. Joseph, the son of
Jacob, married the daughter of Potiphera (whose name means "he whom
[the sun-god] Ra has given"); Potiphera was a priest in On
(Heliopolis), "an important center for the worship of Ra, who had a
temple there." (see Gen. 41:45; citations are from "The NIV Study
Bible," p. 69, c. 1985).

[rluu: Romeman lists several Bible books that Jensen recommends in "The Locust Years".  In this post are links to online PDF copies.  It may be worth reading for expanding my understanding of the Bible.]
