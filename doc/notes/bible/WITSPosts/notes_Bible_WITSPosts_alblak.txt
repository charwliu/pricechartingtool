alblak regarding how to read the Bible:

Hello my friend

I have these rules:

First read the text and look for an obvious interpretation.

Turn on ur "esoteric machine" and use that as interpreter.
This machine use certain keys that exchange the words and the meaning
become much more easy to understand.

If I still dont get it...try to think how u would explain it to a
child.

Still problems:Let it rest in the back of ur head as a question.
Bring it forth from to time and see if ur accumulated knowledge has
increased...if not make the question again and let it rest in the back
of ur head once more etc

If u cant remember the question think like I do :
No brain...no headache.
Then go on a vacation :-)

Tunnel is the same way-
meaning it has ONE KEY WORD and some minors.

best
Allan
