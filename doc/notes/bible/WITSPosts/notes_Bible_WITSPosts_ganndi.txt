ganndi regarding what order to read the books of the Bible:

Concentrate on Ezekiel.............. then go to Genesis....
From there Down Load the Book of ENOCH
Study it and compare to the above
Now you can read the other books of the Bible eg Daniel......Matthew etc

Great Post Jack
Mercury the Communicator...Chief Speaker
Below are other points of interest to consider or to reject

Mercury (alchemy) is quick silver (speedy messenger = Hermes)
Quickly returns from the dead

Bible quotes from the KJV
Romans 16:14
Salute Asyncritus, Phlegon, Hermas, Patrobas, HERMES,
and the brethren which are with them.

Mercury alias Paul in the Bible is the chief speaker (communicator)
See Acts 14:12
And they called Barnabas, JUPITER; and Paul, MERCURIUS,
because he was the Chief Speaker.

Reading TTTA on page 33 we find a reference to Paul
Other references in TTTA to Acts in the Bible are
1) Page 321 Acts 2:17
2) Page 331 Acts 17:26

BTW......Mars is found in Acts 17:19
And they took him, and brought him unto Areopagus*, saying,
May we know what this new doctrine, whereof thou speakest, is?
*Areopagus:- Ares = Mars (thus Mars Hill)

"Hello Ganndi
Could I ask how you gained this understanding of the Language of the Bible
and any directions you may be able to point me to increase my knowledge
to decipher TTTA in this manner.
Thanks

Hello George
read the Bible 3 times just like Gann taught us to do
 
The only difference is that i read it as a child (was forced to)
and i am so thankful that i was forced to read it....probably a dozen times
or more from beginning to end
 
So now i recall my childhood thoughts to simplify my understanding
of Holy Scriptures/Texts
 
One Eye...Cyclops...Uranus...Ouranos...Snake chasing its tail...
that leads me to Oroborus (uroboros, oureboros)...Alchemy
 
Many paths to travel...many dead ends too
 
Read and read and accept or reject what you read
