A system of seven archangels is an old tradition originating in Judaism. However, the earliest reference to a system of seven archangels as a group appears to be in Enoch I (the Book of Enoch) which is not part of the Jewish Scriptures, where they are named as Michael, Gabriel, Raphael, Uriel, Raguel, Zerachiel and Remiel.

In the late 5th to early 6th century , Pseudo-Dionysius gives them as Michael, Gabriel, Raphael, Uriel, Chamuel, Jophiel, and Zadkiel.

The earliest Christian mention is by Pope Gregory I who lists them as Michael, Gabriel, Raphael, Uriel, Simiel [Sammael], Orifiel, and Zachariel [Sachiel].

The Eastern Orthodoxy tradition venerates Michael, Gabriel, Raphael, Uriel, Selaphiel, Jegudiel, and Barachiel.

Another Catholic variation lists them corresponding to the days of the week as: Michael (Sunday), Gabriel (Monday), Raphael (Tuesday), Uriel (Wednesday), Sealtiel (Thursday), Jhudiel (Friday) and Barachiel (Saturday).

In the more modern angelology, different sources disagree on the names and identities of the seven archangels. In the Book of Enoch, Remeil is also described as one of the leaders of the 200 Grigori, the fallen angels. Various occult systems associate each archangel with one of the traditional seven "luminaries" — the Sun, Moon, Mars, Mercury, Jupiter, Venus, and Saturn — but there is disagreement as to which archangel corresponds to which body.
