From Kabala of Numbers, Book 1, pg. 20:

In the 'Exodus', there are 3 consecutive verses, each consisting of 72 letters, which are used for conveying the names of the 72 Principalities known to Kabalists as the Shemhamphoroe, and they are each set over the gates of the temple, six at each gate, and three gates upon each side -- one facing north, another south, one east, and another west.  Astrologers similarly divide the celestial circle into four quadrants, of three signs each, answering to the four quaters of the heavens; and each sign is again divided into three decans of 10 degrees each, and these are split into two of 5 degrees each, so that in all there are 4 x 3 x 3 x 2, or 72 'faces', as they are called, and each carries its own description and characteristics.  

[rluu: See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shemhamphorasch ]
rluu: Thus:
temple == zodiac
gate == zodiac sign
face == 5-degree segment of the zodiac (each gate has 6 of these)

From Kabala of Numbers, Book 2, pg. 34:

The four fixed signs of the zodiac which enter into the composition of the ancient symbols of the Assyrian Bull and the Egyptian Spinx, as well as the Hebrew Cherubim.  

Lion           : Fire  : Spiritual / Spirit : Light
Man            : Air   : Mental / Mind      : Light
Eagle (Dragon) : Water : Psychic            : Dark
Bull           : Earth : Physical           : Dark

Boehme makes them correspond with the four seasons and the four corners of the Earth, or cardinal points.  

Four corners of the Earth == cardinal points

From Kabala of Numbers, Book 2, pg. 36:

For this reason certain numbers are ascribed by the Kabalists to the 12 signs and gates of heavens [see Cosmic Symbolism].

[rluu: Note he uses the word "and" here instead of "or", so are the 12 signs different from the gates of heaven?]]

[rluu: TODO:  Read through Sepharial's "Hebrew Astrology" again, and add notes on it to this document.]
