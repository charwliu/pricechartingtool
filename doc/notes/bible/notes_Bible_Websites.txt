For the Egyptians Saturn was known as "Heru, the Bull of the Sky" or simply as "Heru the Bull" (Parker 1978.719). The bull was seen as a symbol of royal strength, fortitude, stability, power and virility. Through this symbol stability, the established power of the kingdom, was embodied and maintained. In many respects these are all attributes which we, today, ascribe to Saturn.


The equation of the Egyptian Seb (Keb) with the Greek Cronos is not an arbitrary association. Expert Egyptologists and Assyriologists have known for over a hundred years that Seb (Egyptian), Repa (Coptic), Kaiwan (Akkadian), Chiun (Hebrew), Cronos (Greek), and Saturn (Latin) are all names of the same deity. (Budge, 1960; Tyndale, 1962, et al.) Sometimes Seb (Cronos) was associated with a particularly bright "star" in the heavens--known to us as the planet Saturn. 

Just a simple goose or a single star could be used to represent Seb (Cronos). In this respect, it is interesting that the Bible only mentions this Seb-Cronos (Chiun-Rephan) in two places: Amos 5:26 and Acts 7:43. In both the figure of a star plays a prominent part (i.e., the "star of your god"). It is gratifying to see this "star" in the Egyptian glyphs as well. Concerning the reference to the star-god Rephan in the Bible, scholars believe it to be "a deliberate substitution of Repa, a name of Seb, the Egyptian god of the planet Saturn." (Tyndale, 1962)
