"Elements of the Jewish and Muhammadan Calendars" 

pg. 12 says:
The New Moon was proclaimed by the sound of trumpets, and trice repeated the word "Mekudash" -- or "Consecrated".


pg. 40 says:
"Moled" or pl. "Moledoth" is a Hebrew word meaning renewal.  

The Molad for any month is the computed time of New Moon.

The Molad for a year is the Molad for the first month of that year.

The Molad for a Cycle [19-year cycle] is the Molad for the first month of the first year of that Cycle.  


pg. 41

The Jews hold that the world was created by God at the time of the Autumnal Equinox, September 21, in the year of the Julian Period 954, B.C. 3760, and that the Sun and Moon were formed on teh fourth day of the week at 15h. measured from 6h. of the preceeding evening, that is, at 9h. in the morning of feria 4, Wednesday.  [Genesis i. 16, 19].  

But the Mundane Era, the Calendar, adn the computation for the New Moons do not start from this point.  They commence from a fictitious or imaginary MOon, the first Moon of an imaginary or anticipative year next preceding the year of the creation of the world.  

The first day of this imaginary Moon, if it had existed, would have been in the year of the Julian Period 953, on teh second day of the week, feria 2, at 5h. 204ch. after the commencement of that day, that is, at 11h. 204ch. p.m. for the Meridian of Jerusalem.  

This day corresponds to Monday, October 7, B.C. 3761, and the time to 11h. 20m. p.m., or 40m. before the close of that Julian day at midnight.  This day and hour is the Jewish Epoch, or Commencement of the Era, from which all computations for the Calendar are made.

pg. 42

This Molad is said by Scaliger, Petavius, and others to be called the "Molad Tohu", answering to the greek word for "confusion", "nothingness".  It is generally called the "Molad BeHaRD" or "B'HaRaD".

Wikipedia article on the Babylonian Calendar:

Lunar month (Gods prayed to during these days of the lunar month):
 7th day: Merodach and Ishtar
14th day: Ninlil and Nergal
21st day: Sin and Shamash
28th day: Enki and Mah

Tablets fromt eh 6th century BC reigns of Cyrus the Great and the Cambyses indicate these dates were sometimes approximate.  The lunation of 29 or 30 days basically contained three 7-day weeks, and a final week of 8 or 9 days inclusive, breaking the continuous 7-day cycle.


The Babylonians celebrated the 19th day as a special "evil day", the "day of anger", because it was roughly the 49th day of the preceding month, completing a "week of weeks".   Sacrifices were offered to Ninurta and the day dedicated to Gula.  

Full moon was indicated by the word "Sapattu", which is the Sumerian "mid-rest", or "day of mid-repose".  This was monthly rather than weekly as in the Hebrew "Shabbat".  Sabbath was most certainly derived from the Babylonian "Shabbattu", the festival of the full moon.  This conclusion is contextual restoration of the damaged Enuma Elis creation account, which is read as "[Sa]bbath shalt thou then encounter, mid-[month]-ly."


[rluu: Thus, ANGER = 49th day.  Is it always lunar only, or could it be solar or other planets?]
