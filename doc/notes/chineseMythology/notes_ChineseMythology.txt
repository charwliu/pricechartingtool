Yellow Emperor Loses black pearl.  

[rluu: Related to the Silver Springs story in TTTA?]

Yellow Emperor was traveling north of Scarlet River.
He climbed up the Mound of K'un-lun and gazed south.  
On his way back he dropped his black pearl.
He told Chih [Knowledge] to look for it, but he could not find it.
He told Ch'ih Kou [Wrangling Debate] to look for it, but he could not find it.
He told Hsiang-kang [Shapeless] to do so, and Hsiang-kang found it.

The Yellow Emperor said, "That's amazing!  How was Hsiang-kang the one who was able to find it?"

From another text:

The Yellow Emperor made Kang-hsiang search for it and he found it.  Later, because the daughter of the Meng clan, the Lady Chi-hsiang, stole the black pearl, [Kang-hsiang] drowned in the sea and became a god.  

From another text:

According to ancient history, when teh daughter of Chen Meng's clan stole the Yellow Emperor's primeval pearl, he sank into the river and drowned.  He changed into the god of this place.  Today he is the god of the River Tu-miao.

Yellow Emperor and Ch'ih Yu fought 9 times, but for 9 times there was no winner.
The Yellow Emperor returned to T'ai Mountain for three days and three nights.  It was foggy and dim.  There was a woman with a human head and bird's body.  The Yellow Emperor kowtowed, bowed twice, and prostrated himself, not daring to stand up.  The woman said, "I am the Dark Lady.  What do you want to ask me about?" The Yellow Emperor said, "Your humble servant wishes to uestion you about the myriad attacks, the myriad victories."  Then he received the art of war from her.  

[rluu: Is there a connection to Kali of the Hindus here?]

pg. 139

Yi Shoots the 10 Suns to Avert Disaster.

Ti Chun presented Yi with a vermilion bow and plain-colored arrows with silk cords in order that he should bring assistance to the land below.  So Yi was the first to bring merciful relief to teh world below from all its hardships.  

When it came to the era of Yao, the 10 suns all rose at once, scorching the sheaes fo grain and killing plants and trees, so that the people were without food.  And these animals plagued the people:
1) Cha-yu Dragon-Headed beast
2) Chisel-Tusk beast
3) Nine-Gullet beast
4) Giant-Gale bird
5) Feng-hsi wild boar
6) Giant-Head long-snake

So Yao ordered Yi to:
1) Execute the Chisel-Tusk beast in the wilds of Ch'ou Hua.
2) Slaughter the Nine-Gullet beast hear Hsiung River.
3) To shoot down with his corded arrows the Giant-Gale at Ch'ing-ch'iu Marsh.
4) To shoot the 10 suns up above.
5) To kill the Cha-yu Dragon-Head beast below.
6) Behead the Giant-Head long-snake at Tung-t'ing
7) Capture Feng-hsi wild boar at Mulberry Forrest.

The myriad people were overjoyed and decided on Yao as their Son of Heaven.  And so for teh first time in teh whole world, there were roads and signposts in teh broadlands and in teh narrow defiles, in teh deep places, and on level ground both far and wide.

pg. 140

The Rock of the Nine Suns.

The name Wu Chiao is an oxymoron representing the antagonistic elements of fire and water.  Wu is the infinite power and capacity of a divine sea, Chiao is the fabled fiery furness of rock which is where the suns shot down from Yi fell from the sky.  The rock of Wu Chiao is thought to be the Kuroshio Current, or else Mount Min in northern Szechwan.  

From one text:

Wei-lu is where the waters of the seas empty out.  It is called Wu Chiao, and it is in the center of the great ocean.  The Wei is at the very end of all rivers; that is in the center of the great ocean.  The Wei is at the very end of all rivers; that is why it is called Wei [Tail]; lu means 'massed'; it is where water masses together, and that is why it is called lu.  East of Leaning Mulberry there is a rock that is 40,000 leagues all round, and 40,000 leagues thick.  Although the seas and rivers empty into it, it never fails to consume all the water, and that is why it is called Chiao [Consume].  

From another text:

Wu Chiao is east of Pi Sea.  It has a rock that stretches 40,000 leagues across, and it is 40,000 leagues thick.  It lies at the tail end of all flowing rivers; that is why it is called Wei-lu.  According to 'The Classic of Mountains and Seas', in the era of Yao, the 10 suns all rose at once, so Yao ordered Yi to shoot down 9 suns, and they fell into Wu Chiao.

pg. 140-141

Yi Shoots the Lord of the River.

Yi murders the Lord of the River, Ho Po, and appropriates his wife.  

Another text:

God sent down yi Yi to drive away the evils besetting the Hsia people, so why did he shoot down teh Lord of the River and take his wife, Lo-pin?

Another text:

Lo-pin was a water-nymph, and she was called Fu-fei... Yi also dreamed that he had an affair with Fu-fei, teh Gooddess of Lo River.

Another text:

Ju Ch'un says that Fu-fei, the daughter of [?Fu] Hsi, died by drowning in Lo River, and then she became a goddess.  

Another text:

The Lord fo teh River turned into a white dragon and played on teh riverbank.  When yi saw him, he shot him with his arrow, aiming for his left eye.  The Lord of the River went up to complain to God in Heaven: "Kill Yi because of what he has done to me!"  God in Heaven said, "Why were you shot by Yi?"  The Lord of teh river said, "When I transformed myself into a white dragon, I came out to play."  God in Heaven said:  "If you had kept to the river depths as a god, how could Yi have committed this crime against you?  Today you became a reptile, so you were bound to be shot at by someone.  Of course, he was in the right -- what was Yi's crime in this case?"

The Lord of the River killed people by drowning them, so Yi shot him in the left eye.

pg. 143-144

Feng Meng Kills Yi.

Yi and Feng Men were the best archers int eh world.

In archery contests of 100 shots, the most skilled archers were always Yi and Feng Meng.  

Feng Meng learned archery from yi and acquired an exhaustive knowledge of Yi's style of shooting.  He realized that only Yi in the whole world was better than he, so he killed Yi.

"Club" is a large stick, that Feng Meng made out of peach wood to batter Yi to death with.  From that time demons are terrified of peach wood.  

Yi rid the world of evil, so when he died he became the god Tsung Pu.

pg. 144
