Di Ku has 2 sons that fought every day and became star gods:
1) Ebo: Got moved to Shangqiu and assigned charge fo the Chen star.
2) Shichen: Got moved to Daxia and assigned charge of the Shen star.

[rluu: Implication from my reading is that these stars were on opposite sides of the circle.  Is this 2 pentagons inverted in each other?]



Qi means "the Abandoned". [pg. 152] [rluu: Sounds like Moses?]


Di Ku had 4 consorts:

1) Jiang Yuan: Gave birth to Houji, the god of grain and agriculture, by stepping in a giant toe-print in a field.  Houji's original name was Qi (棄, lit. "the Abandoned One").

2) Jiandi:     Gave birth to Qi by swallowing a [colorful] swallow egg.  (there were 2 eggs in some stories).  

3) Qingdu:     Gave birth to Di Yao (Emperor Yao), the 1st of the 3 sage kings.

Center: Female monkey with 3 heads and 6 arms.

Creation story of humans: 

They often visited the monkey and had intercourse with her.  Long afterward, the monkey became pregnant.  After 9,900 years, the monkey produced 99 eggs.  However, all the eggs except the biggest one were stolen by the king of the other 4 eareas.  The biggest egg hatched a python.  Confroming to his monkey mother's request, the python departed to look for those eggs stolen by the kings.  He defeated and devoured those birds, beasts, insects, and fishes/shrimp that tried to hinder him along the way.  Therefore his appearance changed completely.  He became a strange winged creature that had a bull's head, deer's horns, pig's mouth, hawk's paws, and snake's trunk.  He had become a devine dragon that could fly up to teh sky and control the wind and rain.  The 4 kings were so scared by the dragon that they returned all teh eggs to him.  The dargon broke the eggs one by one.  Each time he broke na egg, a creature appeared.  But all those creatures ran away from teh dragon.  The only onees who stayed wiht the dragon were hatched from teh last 2 eggs: They were a man and a woman.  It was they who bore human beings in later time.

Pangu was born from the cosmic egg.

At the very beginning, heaven and earth were in chaotic formlessness like a chicken's egg.  Within this chaos Pangu was born.  

Pangu grew up in the egg while shaping heaven & earth
  - Each day heaven rose 10 feet higher.
  - Each day earth grew 10 feet thicker
  - Each day Pangu grew 10 feet taller.

This situation lasted for 18,000 years.
Since he had to twist his body in this egg, eh got his name which means "coil up" + "antiquity".  

After 18,000 years, Pangu shattered the egg into pieces.
Egg white was light so it became heaven.  
Yolk was heavy so it became earth.
Shell pieces was mixed into the egg white and yolk:
  - Shell pieces that mixed with egg white [heaven] became the stars.
  - 2 larger shell pieces that mixed with heaven became the Sun and Moon.
  - Shell pieces that mixed with yolk      [earth]  became the stones.


pg, 176-178

This gives different variants of the story.

18,000 years Pangu was in the egg, before it was hatched.
Then 18,000 years of expansion:
  - Each day heaven rose 10 feet higher.
  - Each day earth grew 10 feet thicker
  - Each day Pangu grew 10 feet taller.
Then appeared the 3 Sovereigns.


Some versions say that Pangu cut the connection between heaven adn the earth with an adze and chisel.  In order to keep heaven and earth from merging again after he separated them, Pangu himself served as a huge pillar by standing between them.


Pangu's body transformed into the universe after his death:
Breath : winds and clouds
Voice : thunder
Left eye: Sun
Right eye : Moon
Four limbs and trunk : 4 Extremes of the earth and the 5 Mountains.
Blood : Rivers
Veins : Earth's arteries
Flesh : Fields and soil.
Hair and beard : Stars
Skin and body hair : plants
Teeth and bones : Metals and rocks.
Semen and marrow : Pearls and jade.
Sweat : Rain and the dew.
Insects on his body reacted to the wind and turned into human beings.


Fair skin = Moon
Glowing skin = Sun


Story about the Mythical cause of Earthquakes.

In order to separate heaven and earth, Pangu asked a god to lift heaven and tried to find another spirit to hold up the earth.  Since earth was very heavey, Pangu molded an ox with clay and his own saliva.  He blew on the clay ox and it became alive.  Then the divine ox was made to carry the earth.

Additionally, Pangu molded a lcay rooster as a supervisor to keep the ox from falling asleep so as to keep the earth from sinking.  

After thousands of years of supporting the earth on its back, the ox felt so tired that it wished to take a nap.  But the rooster insisted on fulfilling Pangu's instruction and did not allow it.  The ox was so annoyed that it shook its head and body 3 times.  As a result, the earth on the back of the ox shook as well.  That is the origin of earthquakes.  


Pangu's appearance is described as having a dragon's head and a serpent's trunk.  In portraits and temple statues, Pangu usually appears as a man-like giant with a horn on his head.    In Pangu's time, all people were horned.  They used the horn as a weapon in hunting.  Moreover, the horn had a very important function of providing a signal at one's time of death.  When a person was dying, his horn would get soft and loose.  Usually people worked very hard at hunting, but a person who felt his horn become soft and loose would cease working to wait for death.  During a later period, there were so many people whose horns got soft and loose that few people were working.  This annoyed the God of Heaven.  He sent divine troops and took back the horn of humankind.  

Every March 3 of the lunar calendar there is a huge temple fair for Pangu.  These activities will last 7 or 8 days, from March 1 to March 7 or 8.  

It typically is only the supreme god, Jade Emperor, that has the right to send rain, but occasionally other gods who have made great contributions to gods or mankind will be given special permission by the Supreme God to create rain several times a year.  Pangu belongs to this group.  


A deity recorded in two texts in Shanhaijing is thought to be the prototype of the Pangu figure.  This deity is called Zhulong ("Torch Dragon") or Zhuyin ("Torch Shadow").  He was a god with a human face and serpent's trunk, and his body was 1,000 miles in length.  When his eyes opened there was daylight and when they closed it became night.  His hard breath made winter and his hot exhalation made summer.  His appearance and abilities are almost the same as Pangu's.  


[rluu: Pillar might mean something that supports between heaven and earth.]

Gun-Yu flood myth.

Feather mountain (Yushan)

Gun killed by fire god Zhurong.  
3 years the corpse didn't rot.
Belly was opened with a sword, and Yu emerged.
Yu spent 13 years trying to control the flood.
During this period he did not go to his home the 3 time she passed by it.  

Pregnat wife brings Yu food, but Yu is in teh form of a bear.  She runs away and turns into a stone.  Yu shouts to the stone to give back his son.  The stone opens up and out comes Qi (meaning "open up").

The Shang people believe that the founder of Shang, Qi, came from a swallow that was sent down by heaven.  [pg. 35]  [rluu: Is this swallow the same as Jonah/dove?]  Zhou people confirm that their founder, Qi (different from teh Shang's Qi) was born after his mother, Jiang Yuan, stepped into a huge footprint and became pregnant.  



pg. 86

Chang'e steals elixir of immortality from Xiwangmu, the Queen mother of the West. Chang'e consumes it, flew to the moon and became the spirit of the moon.  

This happened on the 15th of August in the lunar calendar (full moon).  

At the night of Mid-autumn festival: chinese people offer mooncakes and round fruits in their yard.  It is said they can see Chang'e, cassia tree, and rabbit on this full moon.  

Sometimes the story says Chang'e turns into a frog or toad on the moon and pounds the elixir in a mortar (undlessly). 

Sometimes it is the jade rabbit that is pounding the elixir.  

The Cassia tree in this sotry was 5,000 feet high.  Wu Gang chops the base of the tree, but the tree heals itself immediately.

pg. 92

Chiyou

Chiyou was the offspring of Yan Di (The Flame Emperor), the god of war, and the inventor of military weapons.  He rebelled against Huang Di, but failed int eh war and was killed.  His shackles turned into a maple tree.


According to legend, Chi You had a bronze head with metal foreheads.[1] He had 4 eyes and 6 arms, wielding terrible sharp weapons in every hand.[5] His head was that of a bull with two horns, but the body was that of a human.[5] He is said to have been unbelievably fierce, and to have had 81 brothers.[5] Historical sources often described him as 'cruel and greedy',[4] as well as 'tyrannical'.[6] Some sources have asserted that the figure 81 should rather be associated with 81 clans in his kingdom.[3]

[rluu: Chi You had 81 brothers, each one 4-eyed.]


Some versions say Chiyou had 80 brothers or 71 brothers.  [pg. 140]  Each of them with an animal body, broze head, and iron forehead, who spoke in a human language.  They used sand and stone as their food.  Other versions state that Chiyou took iron and stone as his food and that he had a human body, horned head, ox hooves, 4 eyes, 6 hands, and ears and temples like swords and spears.  



War between Chiyou and Huang Di.

Chiyou is said to have made weapons and attacked Huang Di.  Thus, Huang Di commanded Yinglong to launch an attack against him in the wilderness of the central plain.  Yinglong began by storing all the water.  Chiou asked Feng Bo and Yu SHi to release a cloudburst. Then Huang Di asked the drought goddess Ba to descend from ehaven and stop the rain.  This eventually killed Chiyou.  


One stody states that when Chiyou attacked Huang Di, no one was able to stop him because he butted people with his horns.  In one version, Chiyou was said to be able to saor into the sky and surmount the dangerous and difficult obstructions.  But Huang Di made a drum from teh hide of Kui, a one-legged mythical beast, and beat it many times.  The sound it made was so great that it prevented Chiyou from flying away.  So Chiyou was caught and killed by Huang Di.  

Another version states that Chiyou led many ferocious mythical animals to attack Huang Di at the Zhuolu plain.  So Huang Di ordered his subjects to blow horns sounding like dragons to threaten them.  

Another version said that Chiyou could stir up clouds and mist.  When he fought with huang Di, he made heavy fog for 3 days.  Huang Di's army was caught in it adn could not figure out their direction.  Huang Di then invented the compass and guided his army out of the fog.  Thus, Huang Di defeated Chiyou and killed him.  When Chiyou was executed, his head and body were cut off and buried in different places, and his shackles turned into a maple tree.  

One version of the myth said that many years after Huang Di won the battle and killed Chiyou, teh world became troubled and confused.  In order to deter his people from revolting, Huang Di drew Chiyou's picture and showed it to them, after which the world became peaceful again.  During the Qin and Han dynasties, Chiyou was worshipped as the god of war by teh army leader and even the first emperor of Qin.  



[rluu-TODO: Read more about the Maple Tree.]

pg. 94-95

Chiyou is worshiped as a remote ancestor of the Miao ethnic people.  In Miao mythology, Jiangyang, an ancestor of the Miao people, was born from the egg of a goddess who was born from a maple tree.  They believe that the maple god can expel evils.  In certain areas, a traditional festival called "Trembling the Flower Mountain" is held once a year.  It is said taht this festival originated fromt eh Chiyou mythic event.  After being defeated by Huang Di, Chiyou led his tribes back into the thickly forrested mountains.  In order to call together the scattered people over the mountains, he planted a long trunk with a colorful red waistband on the mountain and asked the young to dance and blow reed pipes around it.  On hearing the sound, people came from all directions.  Chiyou gathered them, and they continued to fight against huang Di.  There is a custom of dancing and blowing reed pipes around a flower-wreathed pole.  The defeat of Chiyou is why the Miao people had to flee from the Central Plain towards the southern mountains.  

pg. 94

Cords of the earth:

Cords are tied to the earth to prevent it from collapsing.  Usually the holder is a divine creature such as a turtle, cow, fish, dragon, or snake.

4 cords tied up to the 4 corners of the square earth.  

In some ancient texts, earth cords were said to have been broken off during a war in the remote past.  

Nuwa melted stones of 5 different colors to repair the defective sky, and cut the legs from a huge tortoise and set them up to support the four extremities of the sky.  

[rluu-TODO: Read the wikipedia article on this.  This is related to the flood and starting over again.]


pg. 95-96

Crow of the Sun.

The crow of the sun functions as the spirit of the sun, or, in some versions, the bearer of the sun across the sky.  

In the great wilderness, there was a huge tree named Fusang (Leaning mulberry) growing on the top of a mountain.  Its trunk reached a height of 300.  Beside the mountain there was a valley named Tang Valley, in which another Fusang tree was growing.  Here was the place from which the 10 suns rose adn set back down.  As soon as one sun came back from its journey crossing the sky, another sun started forth.  Each of the 10 suns was carried by a crow.  

"Why did Yi shoot down teh suns?  Why did the crows shed their feathers?"
This quote cites a paragraph to explain these questions:

At the time of Yao (a demigod and one of the 3 sage kings), the 10 suns rose together and burned up the woods and grass.  Yao then ordered Yi to shoot down the 10 suns in teh sky, and Yi shot down 9 of them.  The 9 crows settling in these suns died, and their feathers fell out.  It seems taht the cros in teh suns, which function as the sun's spirits are in some degree different from those who are bearers of the suns, whose main function is to carry each sun across the sky while they are on duty.  

In some versions, the crow of the sun is sometimes said to be 3-legged.  


[rluu: What is the 6 Dynasties Era?]

There are 2 sorts of mythical grasses of immortality that grew in the Northeast and Southwest:
1) Di Ri      (Di = "ground", ri = "sun")
2) Chun Sheng (chun = "spring", sheng = "grow")

The 3-legged crow liked eating these grasses very much.  It descended from heaven to earth several times in order to eat them.  But Xihe, the mother of the 10 suns, did not like it to do so.  She wanted to control teh crow, so she covered its eyes with her hands to stop it from flying down.  



pg. 97

Di Jun or Emperor Jun.

He is a companion to Xihe, mother of the suns, and a companion to Changxi, mother of the moons.  Many of his descendants are famous culture heroes or demigods.  

"Jun" this' name are found only in the "shanhaiching" ("wilderness", "home in" the two mentioned several times). "Handsome" is the original meaning of "at the top of the Pyramid people". "Jun" a word literally means "at the top of the Pyramid'".



In the Great Wilderness lived a flock of 5-colored birds.  They were dancing in pairs.  The god Di Jun desired to go down tot he earth and make friends with them.  These birds looked after his 2 altars on teh earth.  This story is recorded in chapter 14 in text Shanhaijing; according to a text in chapter 16, the 5-colored bird is a type of phoenix.  

In the story from chapter 18, Di Jun is described as the god who bestowed special power on the archer Yi.  he gave Yi a red bow, and arrows with white feathers, placing Yi on teh earth to help all the countries there.  Therefore Yi started his work of saving people from hardship.  

[rluu: Notice the colors: Red and White.  They are the same colors as the Divine Mercy.]

A text in chapter 17 concerns Di Jun's bamboo forest.  Beyond the northeast seas, in the Great Wilderness around the river, there was a mountain named Mount Fuyu.  Beside the mountain there was a mound.  It was about 300 in circumference.  To the South of the mound lay Di Ku's bamboo forrest.  The bamboo there was so large that just one knot of it could be used to make a boat.  

[rluu: Does this match a mound in the bible?  It sounds like the bamboo here are the Lebonnon cedars?  We get a number "300" from this.]


Di Jun's 2 consorts were Xihe and Changxi.  

Beyond the east sea, and next ot eh Gan Gulf was the kingdom of Xihe.  A lady named Xihe married Di Jun and gave birth to the 10 suns.  She spends her time bathing the suns in the Gan Gulf.

In the Great Wilderness there was a mountain called mount Riyue (Mount Suna dn moon).  It was in the key position of the heavens.  At this mountain there was a lady, Changxi, who waalso was Di Jun's wife.  Changxi had given birth to 12 moons.  In the text, Changxi was just beginning ot bathe them.  

Di Jun's descendants founded the kingsdoms of:
1) Zhongrong
2) Siyou
3) Baimin
4) Heichi
5) Sanshen


They all were extraordinary peopel who possessed special powers, especially the power to control the 4 beasts:
1) Tiger
2) Panther
3) Bear
4) Brown bear.


Di Jun also had 8 sons that created songs and dance.  
[rluu: It's not clear that he only had 8 sons.]

The Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_Sovereigns_and_Five_Emperors

In myth, the three sovereigns were demigods who used their abilities to help create mankind and impart essential skills and knowledge. The five emperors were exemplary sages possessed of great moral character.


The Three Sovereigns, sometimes known as the Three August Ones, were said to be god-kings or demigods who used their magical powers to improve the lives of their people. Because of their lofty virtue, they lived to a great age and ruled over a period of great peace. The Three Sovereigns are ascribed various identities in different Chinese historical texts. 


3 Sovereigns:

1) Heavenly Sovereign (天皇), 
2) Earthly Sovereign (地皇),
3) Tai Sovereign (泰皇)

or
1) Fu Xi (伏羲), 
2) Nüwa (女媧), 
3) Shennong (神農)


Sovereign series (帝王世系) says they are:
1) Fu Xi (伏羲), 
2) Shennong (神農), 
3) Yellow Emperor (黃帝)




Heavenly Sovereign:
-------------------
According to Book of History (史記),
    After the heaven and the earth were founded, there was Tiānhuáng who had 12 heads, cast his magic to fill the earth with water. He lived until his age of 18,000.
    Or, Tiānhuáng was a king of many achievements, lived to 18,000 years old. His 12 children supported him in reigning the world.

His greatest achievement was suppressing all the chaos, divided the world to many tribes with choosing the best person to rule his tribe.

[rluu: 12 heads, lived to age of 18,000.  Had 12 children.]


Earthly Sovereign (地皇, Dìhuáng)

    Or, Dìhuáng was a king of many achievements, was of 11 brothers, lived to 18,000 years old.

After he was born, the world was filled in chaos. That year, the sun and the moon born from two eyes of Pangu, the stars from his hairs couldn't move smoothly and correctly, which caused many days without sun, or many days with the sun shined all over each day, or many dangerous fallen star accidents. With his power, Dìhuáng corrected the false. He made the sun, the moon move correctly, and stipulated the days of a month, the months of a year.

Dìhuáng`s rule lasted eleven thousand years.

He created Mount Xiong'er (熊耳山 Xióng'ĕr Shān) and Mount Longmen (龍門山 Lóngmén Shān).

[rluu: 11 heads.  Was of 11 brothers.  Lived to 18,000 years old.]

His greatest achievement was dividing China to 9 provinces, built the united dynasty lasting 45,000 thousand years.


[rluu: 7 heads.  Was of 9 brothers.  Led 9 provinces.  Ruled for 150 generations.  Lasted for 45,000 years.]




[rluu: Total: 18 + 18 + 45 = 81]

The Five Emperors according to:
Records of the Grand Historian (史記)

1) Yellow Emperor (Huang Di) (黃帝), 
2) Zhuanxu (顓頊),

In the Sovereign Series (帝王世紀), 
Shaohao (少昊), is named instead of Yellow Emperor.



----------------

Yellow Emperor:
Battles
Main articles: Battle of Zhuolu and Battle of Banquan

According to traditional accounts, the Yan emperor meets the force of the "Nine Li" (九黎) under their bronze-headed leader, Chi You,[33] and his 81 horned and four-eyed brothers[9] and suffers a decisive defeat. He flees to Zhuolu and begs the Yellow Emperor for help. During the ensuing Battle of Zhuolu the Yellow Emperor employs his tamed animals and Chi You darkens the sky by breathing out a thick fog.[43] This leads the emperor to develop the South Pointing Chariot, which he uses to lead his army out of the miasma.[9][43] He next calls upon the drought demon Nuba to dispel Chi You's storm.[9][43] He then destroys the Nine Li and defeats Chi You[44] before falling out with the Yan emperor, defeating him at Banquan[33] and replacing him as the primary ruler.[35]
Death
Main article: Mausoleum of the Yellow Emperor

The Yellow Emperor was said to have lived for over a 100 years before meeting a phoenix and a qilin and then dying.[1] Two tombs were built in Shaanxi within the Mausoleum of the Yellow Emperor, in addition to others in Henan, Hebei and Gansu.[45]

Modern-day Chinese people sometimes refer to themselves as the "Descendants of Yan and Yellow Emperor"

Upon his death he rose into the heavens and became a Xian (or Hsien), an immortal . 


[rluu: It's not clear how long he lived.]

Shaohao

One of the most notable supreme gods in Chinese mythology.  Shaohao founded his capital in the east, but later was known as the god who reigns over the west and controls the season of autumn.  

[rluu: Autumn season, reigns over the West.]


Other aliases:
  - Jintianshi (literally "Metal Sky").  
  - Zhi
  - Zhuxuan
  - Baidi ("White God; accounting to the theory of 5 elements and 5 colors, the west belongs to metal, and its color is white).


Birth story:
During the time of Huang Di, a big star shining like a rainbow fell down to the Hua Islet.  A divine lady named Nujie caught it in her dream.  Then she got pregnant and later gave birth to Shaohao (Zhuxuan).  

Another version maintains that he was the son of Jin Xing (the planet Venus) and a beautiful divine lady named Huang'e.  

The book Shiyiji states that Shaohao's mother, Huang'e (litterally meaning a beautiful divine woman), lived in a jade palace and wove at night.  Sometimes, during the day, she traveled far away by a raft to the boundless reach of Qiongsang, which, in that story, was located on teh shore of the west sea.  There was a mulberry tree on the shore.  It was 8000 feet in height, and it produced fruit every 10,000 years.  If one ate its fruit, one was able to live longer than heaven.  At that time, there was a handsome child-god named "the Son of White God" (here Shaohao became the grandson of the White God instead of being the White God himself) who actually was the spirit of Jin Xing (the planet Venus) descended at Qionsang.  He feasted and played with Huang'e.  They floated on the sea; meanwhile they played fantastic music and sang songs in response to each other.  To discern the wind direction, they set up a mast in the front of their raft, tied thatched grass to the mast as a flag, and carved a jade cuckoo bird on the top of the mast, because the cuckoo bird knew the 4 seasons.  What they did originated the custom of xiangfeng (whereby peopel carve a wooden or copper bird and then put it on teh top of their roofs or masts to discern the wind direction).  Later Huang'e gave birth to Shaohao.  He was also named Qiongsangshi or Jintianshi (shi here is a respectful title for gods and nobles).  Since 5-colored phoenixes came to his yard when he was born, he was also called Fengniaoshi (meaning "Phoenix Bird").

Though the text from Shiyiji asserts that Shaohao was born in the west, some ancient writings show that he perhaps originated from the east.  

Text in Zuozhuan says that when Shaohao founded his state, phoenixes appeared.  He thus decided to give his subordinates bird names.  For example:
 - Fengniaoshi (meaning "Phoenix Bird") took charge of the calendar.
 - Xuanniaoshi ("Swallow") took charge of the equinoxes.
 - Bozhaoshi ("Butcherbird") took care of the summer and winter solstices.
 - Qingniaoshi ("Green Bird") took charge of the beginnings of spring and summer
 - Danniaoshi ("Red Bird") took charge of the beginnings of autumn and winter.

[Text then lists in addition to the 5 bird names for officials, also, 5 Jiu (5 kinds of doves), 5 Zhi (5 kinds of pheasants), and 9 Hu birds (to preside over agriculture).]

[rluu: Thus by my count: 5 + 5 + 5 + 9 = 24]

Shaohao

Legend says that his mother, a weaver goddess, was a beautiful fairy named Huange who fell in love with the planet Venus while drifting along the Milky Way. The two enjoyed many intimate nights together on her raft and they created a son. She soon gave birth to Shaohao, who grew up to be a handsome young man with a lot of potential. His great uncle, Huang Di, was so impressed with him that he named him God of the Western Heavens.

The myth says that Shaohao created a kingdom in the five mountains of the Eastern Paradise that was inhabited by different types of birds. As the ruler of this bureaucratic land, he captured the identity of a vulture. Other birds worked below him, such as a phoenix as his Lord Chancellor, a hawk that delegated the law, and a pigeon that was in charge of education. He chose the four seasons of the year to watch over the remaining birds.



Although his kingdom was successful for many years, he moved back to the west and left his kingdom of birds to his son Chong. With a different son, Ru Shou, he made his home on Changliu Mountain, where he could rule over the Western Heavens. In union as father and son, they were responsible for the daily setting of the sun. In addition, Shaohao was thought to have introduced China to the twenty-five string lute.


[rluu: number 25]


Preceded by
Yellow Emperor 	Emperor of China
c. 2597 BC – c. 2514 BC 	Succeeded by
Zhuanxu

[rluu: covers a period of rule of 83 years.]


----------------

Zhuanxu led the Shi clan in an eastward migration to present-day Shandong, where intermarriages with the Dongyi clan enlarged and augmented their tribal influences. At age twenty, he became their sovereign, going on to rule for seventy-eight years until his death.

In mythology, Zhuanxu is also mentioned as a Polar Star god and father of Taowu "the Block".


[rluu: 20 + 78 = 98]




----------------

According to speculative dates (calculated after 100 BC by Liu Xin) he is supposed to have ruled from c. 2436 BC to c. 2366 BC, though other dates are also mentioned.

[rluu: if these years are correct, then it is a lifespan of 70 years.]


After achieving the imperial title, Ku was said to travel seasonally by riding a dragon in spring and summer, and a horse in autumn and winter.[6] Among other things, Ku was an inventor of musical instruments and composer of songs. 


According to some traditions, Ku had four sons to four different wives
He is also said to have had two sons who became star gods, Ebo and Shichen.
Sons:
1) Houji
2) Xie
3) Yao
4) Zhi

Ku's son Xie, born miraculously to Jiandi after she swallowed the egg of a black bird, became the predynastic founder of the ruling family of the Shang dynasty. 

Ku's son Houji, born miraculously to Jiang Yuan after she stepped in the footprint of a god, became the predynastic founder of the lineage of the Zhou dynasty.


It also states that Ku "was born with double rows of teeth, and had the wisdom of a sage", and that he "made blind men beat drums, and strike bells and sounding stones, at which phoenixes flapped their wings and gambolled". 

The Annals further record that in the 16th year of his reign, he sent his general Chung to defeat the state of Yukwai. In the 45th year, Ku designated the prince of Tang (his son Yao) as his successor, however upon his death in the 63rd year, his elder son Zhi then took the throne instead, ruling 9 years before being deposed and replaced by Yao.

------------


According to the legend, Yao became the ruler at 20 and died at 119 when he passed his throne to Shun the Great, to whom he gave his two daughters in marriage.

The Bamboo Annals offers a different story. Shun rebelled and imprisoned Yao where he is left to die. Danzhu is exiled and later defeated by Shun.

[rluu: Became a ruler at age 20, and died at 119.]

---------------

According to traditional sources, Shun received the mantle of leadership from Emperor Yao at the age of 53, and then died at the age of 100 years. Before his death Shun is recorded as relinquishing his seat of power to Yu: an event which is supposed to have eventuated in the establishment of the Xia Dynasty. Shun's capital was located in Puban (蒲阪), presently located in Shanxi).

Under Emperor Yao, Shun was appointed successively Minister of Instruction, General Regulator and chief of the Four Peaks, and put all affairs in proper order within three years.




After ascending to the throne, Shun offered sacrifices to God, as well as to the hills, rivers, and the host of spirits.[4] Then he toured the eastern, the southern, the western, and the northern parts of the country; in each place he offered burnt-offering to Heaven at each of the four peaks (Mount Tai, Mount Huang, Mount Hua and Mount Heng), sacrificed to the hills and rivers, set in accord the seasons, months, and days, established uniform measurements of length and capacities, and reinforced ceremonial laws.[5]

Shun divided the land into twelve provinces, raising altars upon twelve hills in each, and deepening the rivers.[6] Shun dealt with four criminals: banishing the Minister of Works to You island, confining Huan-dou on Mount Chong; driving San-Miao into San-Wei, and holding Gun a prisoner till his death on Mount Yu.[7] Yu was subsequently appointed Minister of Works to govern the water and the land.[8] Later, Shun appointed Yu to be General Regulator (Prime Minister).[8] Yu wished to decline in favour of the Minister of Agriculture, or Xie, or Gao Yao, but finally accepted upon Shun's insistence.[8] Shun then appointed Chui as the new Minister of Works.[9] Shun also appointed Yi as Minister of Animal Husbandry to govern the beasts and trees of the land,[10] Bo-yi as Priest of the Ancestral Temple to perform religious ceremonies,[11] Hui as Director of Music,[12] Long as Minister of Communications to counter deceptions and false reports.[13]



When Emperor Yao became old, he distressed over the fact that his 9 sons were all useless, only knew how to spend their days enjoying themselves with wines and songs. Yao asked his administers, the Four Mountains, to propose a suitable successor. Yao then heard of Shun's tales. Wise Yao did not want to simply believe in the tales about Shun, so he decided to test Shun. Yao gave a district to Shun to govern and married his two daughters to him, with a small dowry of a new house and some money. [story continues.]


Shun began to reign at the age of 30, reigned with Yao for 30 years, and reigned 50 years after Yao's death, then Shun died.[14]

Events of Shun's reign

    In the 3rd year of his reign, he ordered Jiutao (咎陶) to establish penalties to deal with various criminals.
    In the 9th year of his reign, the West Queen came to worship in China and brought white jade rings and Jue (玦) as gifts.
    In the 14th year of his reign, Yu of Xia was appointed to manage disasters caused by floods and winds.
    In the 15th year of his reign, he appointed Houshi (后氏) to build the palace.
    In February of the 17th year, dancing was first taught at schools.
    In the 25th year of his reign, envoy of the Xishen (息慎) tribe came and, as gifts, brought the bow and arrow.
    In the 29th year, he ordered Ziyi (子义) to serve as duke in Shang.
    In the 30th year of his reign, his wife Mang (盲) died and was honored with a tomb built for her at Wei (渭).
    In the 32nd year of his reign, he transferred military power to Yu of Xia.
    In January of the 33rd year of his reign, he rewarded Yu of Xia for his achievement in managing the floods, in the aftermath of which, nine provinces were re-established in China.
    In the 35th year of his reign, he ordered Yu of Xia to send troops to Youmiao (有苗). After Yu achieved victory, Youmiao sent an envoy with a request to join China.
    In his 36th year of his reign, he ordered the Great Wall (of Shun's time, not the current Great Wall of China) to be torn down.
    In the 42nd year of his reign, the Xuandu (玄都) people came to worship him and brought precious jade as gifts.
    The winter of the 47th year of his reign was very warm and the grass did not die.
    In the 49th year of his reign, he moved to Mingtiao (鸣条), a place later called Haizhou (海州) during the Warring States Period. His death came the following year, after a rule described as having lasted fifty years.

Huang Di (Yellow Emperor).
He is also named Xuanyuan (cart/chariot).
(xuan refers to a high-fronted, curtained carriage used in ancient times, and yuan refers to the shafts fo a cart).
(The "Xuanyuan Fang" was a compass cart constructed by Huang Di, and used by him in the war.)

Huang Di lived for 300 years.
Huang Di had 4 faces.

Huang Di was the son of Shaodian.  
Huang Di was the half brother of Yan Di (Emperor of the south).  

Huang Dihad 4 wives:
  - Leizu (she started sericulture, the cultivation of silkworms and silk production.  Huang Di honored her as the Road Goddess.)
  - Momu (unsightly in appearance but of great virtues.  she supervises the other concubines.)
       

He is also the most important of the Five August Emperors (names differ in different texts).  He defeated Yan Di, Chiyou, and other deities.  

In some descriptiosn, he functions as the Thunder God.  

Huang Di is portrayed as a human being with 4 faces.  

About his birth:
His mother, Fubao, saw a great bolt of lightning one night circling one of the stars in the Great Bear.  It was so bright that it lit up the area nearby.  Then Fubao became pregnant, and after 25 months, she gave burth to Huang Di.  

From the text Dadai Liji:
1) When Huang was just born, he was smart.
2) When he was a baby, he could talk.
3) When he was a child, he was quick.
4) When he grew up, he was honest and clever.
5) When he was an elder, he was wise.


Huang Di was 300 years old when he died.

Huang Di often appears as the ruler of the central part of hte world.  

A text from Huainanzi sets Huang Di and the other 4 divine emperors in an orderly pantheon distributed in 5 directions (East, South, West, North, and Center) and 5 elements (wood, fire, metal, water, and earth).  

Direction:      God:       Subordinate:     Description:
----------     -------     -------------    -------------
East (wood):    Taihao.    Goumang.         Both hold the compass and control 
                                            the season of spring.
South (fire):   Yan Di.    Zhuming.         both hold the beams of steelyards 
                                            and control the season of summer.  
Center (earth): Huang Di.  Houtu.           Both hold ropes and control 
                                            the 4 directions.  
West (metal):   Shaohao.   Rushou.          Both hold carpenter's squares and 
                                            control the season of autumn.
North (water);  Zhuanxu.   Xuanming.        Both hold sliding weights of 
                                            steelyards and control the 
                                            season of winter. 

Huang Di was the most powerful ruler of the center and the other 4 directions.  

[rluu: It appears that Huang Di is equated to Levi and the Levites.  
The battle between Huang Di and the other 4 Emperorers appears to map up to the siege of New York in TTTA?  Huang Di went to fortify the walls and commanded the army himself and in the end defeated the four emperors.


Yan Di (Flame Emperor) is the half brother of Huang Di.  Yan Di is said to have controlled hlfo the world while Huang Di controlled the other half.  Huang Di ruled his kingdom based on benevolence and love, but Yan Di did not follow these principles.  They fought at the open plain of Zhuolu.  It was a fierce battle; blood flowed like a stream that could float the pestles.  At last Huang Di killed Yan Di and took his land.  The world then became peaceful.  

According to another text:

When Huang Di fought Yan Di, he ordered these animals:
1) Black bears
2) Grizzly bears
3) Wolves
4) Panthers
5) Cougars
6) Tigers

Huang Di's banners:
1) Eagles
2) Fighting pheasants
3) Falcons
4) Phoenixes

Another myth states that the battle between the two brothers lasted for a long time.  Huang Di fought against his brother many times before finally winning the war.  

---

Battle between Huang Di and Chiyou.
Chiyou is the descendant of Yan Di.  
Chiyou has either many brothers (various versions say: 80, 71, or 81)

Each brother had an animal body, bronze head, and iron forehead, speaking a human language.  They used sand and stone as their food.  Other versions state that Chiyou had a human body, horned head, ox hooves, 4 eyes, 6 hands, and ears and temlpes like swords and spears.  He seems to be a former subordinate of Huang Di, but later he somehow became a rebel.  

Chiyou made weapons and attacked Huang Di, so Huang Di commanded Yinglong to launch an attack against Chiyou in the wilderness of the central plain.  Yinglong began by storing all teh water.  Chiyou asked Feng Bo and Yu Shi to release a cloudburst.  Then Huang Di asked the drought goddess Ba to descend from heaven, and the rain was stopped.  Eventually Huang Di killed Chiyou.  

Many stories describing the course and circumstances of the war.  One story states that Chiyou was able to soar into the sky and surmount the dangerous and difficult obstructions.  But Huang Di made a drum from the hide of Kui, a 1-legged mythical creature, and beat it many times.  The sound it made was so great that it revented Chiyou from flying away, and he was caught and killed by Huang Di.  

Another version states that Chiyou led many ferocious mythical animals to attack Huang Di on the Zhuolu plain.  In response, Huang Di ordered his subjects to blow horns sounding like dragons to threaten them.  

Another version asserts that Chiyou could stir up clouds and mist.  When he fought with Haung Di, he made heavy fog for 3 days.  Huang Di's army was caught in it and could not determine their direction.  Huang Di then invented the compass cart and guided his army out of the fog.  Thus Huang Di defeated Chiyou and killed him.  

[rluu: Compass cart is the "South Pointing Chariot".  see pg. 142 and wikipedia.]

Some versions maintain that after Huang Di fought against Chiyou many times, and still could not win, he retreated with his army to Mount Tai.  There was a thick fog lasting for 3 days.  In the fog, Huang Di saw a lady with a woman's head and a serpent's body.  he kowtowed, bowed twice, flattened himself against the ground and did not dare stand up.  The lady said, "I am Xuan Nu (litterally "Dark Lady")".  Huang Di asks for 'myriad attacks', myriad wins.  So the goddess taught himt eh art of war, and he defeated Chiyou in the end.  

[rluu: Dark Lady is Kali.  See my timeline of Hindu holidays with the Kali connection to 3 days.]

In some accounts, huang Di is said to 'have fought 55 times and then the whole world obeyed him.'

[rluu: 55 fights.]


pg. 142

Huang Di's cultural inventions:
1) Drilled wood for fire and then cooked fresh meat.
2) Hollowed a tree trunk to make a boat and cut branches to make oars.  Therefore peopel could travel by water.
3) He tamed cattle and horses to draw carts so that the peopel could use them to carry heavy goods.
4) Inspiried by teh erigeron that could endlessly rotate in teh wind, he made the wood cart.  And that is why he was also called Xuanyuan ('xuan' refers to a high-fronted, curtained carriage used in ancient times, and yuan refers to the shafts of a cart.).  
5) He cut trees and used them to build a variety of houses to protect people from teh wind and rain.  
6) He invented hats, crowns, and clothes.
7) He cut wood to make pestles and dug earth to make mortar.  
8) He made a caldron to steam rice.  
[...]


After he met the goddess Xiwangmu, he made 12 mirrors and used one in each month.  So it was also Huang Di who invented the mirror.  

He invented coffins for the dead.  After he killed Chiyou, he buried him, and that originated the custom of burial.  

He is said to make the rules for wedding ceremonies.  

****
Among his numerous inventions, the compass cart is famed.  


Explaination of how Huang Di invented the compass cart.  
Huang Di was a chieftain in the central plain.
Yan Di was a chieftain in the east.  
Admiring the better life in teh central plain, Yan Di commanded his clan to attack Huang Di's.  
Thoguh Yan Di failed in the battle, the winner, Huang Di, wanted to ally with him.

They became sworn brothers, and their clans were united into one large country.  Meanwhile, in teh southeast, there was another clan, and its leader was Chiyou.  Chiyou also coveted the prosperity of the central plain, so he ordered his people to invade the central plain.  Huang Di then commanded his army to fight Chiyou.  it was the middle of autumn, and there often was heavy fog.  Having difficulties discerning the direction, Huang Di's army was defeated several times.  Therefore, Huang Di spent much time in discovering a means for telling the directions.  At length he found that a kind of magentite could help.  He then made a carved wooded man with a magnetite hand installed in it.  No matter where he was, the magnetite hand always pointed to the south.  Therefore Huang Di named it Fang ('Direction').  Later Huang Di built a cart and fixed the carved man on it, so it could easily be moved around.  Huang Di called the whole system Xuanyuan Fang.  Sometime later the name was changed to "compass cart".

pg. 143
Taoists say that Huang Di "ascended to heaven" at the end of his secular life.  

From the text Shiji:
Huang Di gathered copper at Mount Shoushan.  He used it to make a big ding (a tripot caldron).  When the ding had been made, a dragon witha long beard descended from heaven to meet him.  Huang Di rode on it, and more than 70 of his officials and concubines followed him.  Since there were too many lower subordinates to ride onteh dragon, they grabbed on to the dragon's beard and were dragged along underneath.  They were so heavy that they pulled the beard out before the dragon could ascend to heaven.  Huang Di's bow also fell.  With Huang Di ascending ot heaven, people on teh ground held his bow and the dragon's beard and cried.  From then on, the place was called Ding Hu (hu means "beard"), and the bow was called Wuhao (meaning "cry").  



Huang Di's birthday is March 3 in the Chinese lunar calendar.

Jiandi
Second wife of Di Ku.

Story of the conception and birth of Qi:

There were once two beautiful girls (one of which was Jiandi).  They lived in a terrace 9 stories high.  Each meal they ate had to be accompanied by drum music.  One day the Supreme Divinity (Di) sent a swallow to visit them.  The swallow sweetly sang, repeating "Yiyi".  The two girls loved it so much that they tried to catch the swallow.  Finally they covered it with a jade basket.  When they lifted up teh basket after a while, the swallow flew away immediately toward the North, leaving two eggs behind.  The girls were so diappointed that they composed a song, singing "Swallow, swallow, you flew away", which is credited with being the origin of the northern music.  [rluu: Musical vibration starts?].    Another commentator wrote that the Supreme Divinity was in fact the God of Heaven, it was he who ordered the swallow to lay two eggs for the girls to swallow so that one would give birth to Qi.  

[rluu: Numbers 9, a swallow, and 2 eggs.  One of the eggs spawn Qi.]


Another version:

One day Jiandi and her sisters went out to take a bath in the river of Xuanqui when they saw a swallow passing by and dropping a colorful egg.  They all competed with each other to catch it, and Jiandi won.  Protecting it from being seized by her sisters, she put the egg into her mouth, but swallowed it by accident.  Then she became pregnant and later gave birth to Qi.  

[rluu: Colorful egg.]

From wikipedia article:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_Sovereigns_and_Five_Emperors

There is also the legend of the Four shi (四氏) who took part in creating the world. The four members are Youchao-shi (有巢氏), Suiren-shi (燧人氏), Fu Xi-shi (伏羲氏), and Shennong-shi (神農氏).[5]


Numbers: 
115 + 110 + 500 = 725 = 25 * 29
or 
115 + 110 + 500 + 39 = 764 = 191 * 4



------

Youchao (Chinese: 有巢, pinyin: Yǒucháo), is the inventor of house and building, according to China's ancient mythology. It is said he is one of The Three August Ones in remote ancient China.[citation needed]
He was also the second ruler of China, who ruled for 110,000 years.



Suiren (Chinese: 燧人, pinyin: suì rén), is the discoverer of fire, according to Chinese mythology. He is one of the legendary Three August Ones from ancient Chinese history. Images of Suiren depict him as having three eyes. He is said to have reigned half a million years during the Pleistocene epoch.

[rluu: 500,000 years?]


In Chinese mythology, Fu Xi (Fuxi) or Fu Hsi (Fu-hsi) (Chinese: 伏羲; pinyin: Fúxī; Wade–Giles: Fu2-hsi1), also known as Paoxi or Pao-hsi (simplified Chinese: 庖牺; traditional Chinese: 庖犧; pinyin: Páoxī; Wade–Giles: Pao2-hsi1), reigned during the mid-29th century BCE, was the first of the Three Sovereigns (三皇 Sānhuáng) of ancient China. He is a culture hero reputed to be the inventor of writing, fishing, and trapping. However, Cangjie is also said to have invented writing.


According to legend, the land was swept by a great flood and only Fu Xi and his sister Nüwa survived. They retired to the mythological Kunlun Mountain, where they prayed for a sign from the Emperor of Heaven. The divine being approved their union and the siblings set about procreating the human race. In order to speed up the process, Fu Xi and Nüwa used clay to create human figures, and with the power divine entrusted to them made the clay figures come alive.[1] Fu Xi then came to rule over his descendants, although reports of his long reign vary between sources, from 115 years (2852–2737 BCE) to 116 years (2952–2836 BCE).

Fu Xi is said to have lived for 197 years altogether and died at a place called Chen (modern Huaiyang, Henan), where a monument to him can still be found and visited as a tourist attraction.[1]

[rluu: Reign of either 115 or 116.  Lifespan was 197.]


Shennong (Shen-nung; simplified Chinese: 神农; traditional Chinese: 神農; pinyin: Shénnóng; Wade–Giles: Shen2-nung2; Japanese: Shinno, 神農; Korean: 신농, Sinnong; Vietnamese: Thần Nông), whose name literally means "Divine Farmer" and who is also known as the Emperor of the Five Grains (t 五穀先帝, s 五谷先帝, p Wǔgǔxiāndì), was a legendary ruler of China and culture hero. Shennong is considered to have been one of the Three Sovereigns (also known as "Three Emperors") who lived some 5,000 years ago.

In Chinese mythology Shennong, besides having taught humans the use of the plow together with other aspects of basic agriculture, the use of medicinal plants, and having been a god of the burning wind (perhaps in some relationship to the Yan Emperor mythos and/or slash-and-burn agriculture,[3] in which the ash produced by fire fertilizes the fields), was sometimes said to be a progenitor to, or to have had appointed as one of his ministers, Chi You; and like him, they were both ox-headed, sharp-horned, bronze-foreheaded, and iron-skulled.[4] One difference between mythology and science is exemplified in Chinese mythology: Shennong and Huangdi (often known as "the Yellow Emperor") were supposedly friends and fellow scholars, despite the 500 years or seventeen or eighteen generations between the first Shennong and Huangdi; and, that together they shared the alchemical secrets of medicine, immortality, and making gold.

The sacrifice of cows or oxen to Shennong in his various manifestations is never at all appropriate, instead pigs and sheep are acceptable. Fireworks and incense may also be used, especially at the appearance of his statue on his birthday, lunar April 26, according to popular tradition. 

c. 2737 BC – c. 2698 BC
[rluu: This interval is 39 years.]

Jiang Yuan

The first consort of Di Ku, and the mother of Houji.  

Jiang yuan stepped into a huge footprint in a field and miraculously gave birth to Houji, the God of Agriculture and founder of the Zhou people.  

Poem from "Shijing" text:

The first birth of our people was from Jiang Yuan.  How did she give birth to a person?  She had offered a sacrifice to the Supreme Divinity, to ward off the misfortune of childlessness.  By chance, she stepped into a huge toe-print made by the Supreme Divinity, and her body was stirred.  She then began to live in a separate room undistrubed.  Jiang Yuan became pregnant, and she behaved even more devoutly and solemnly.  She gave birth to a son who was Houji.  When her birth had come to full-term, she delivered as easy as the birth of a lamb.  Then she abandoned her son on a narrow lane, but the sheep and oxen protected him and fed him.  She tried to place him in a forest, but gave up there because there happened to be many wood-cutters there.  She then threw him away on cold ice, and a bird sheltered and supported him with its wings.  When the bird flew away, Houji began to wail.  His cry was so long and loud, that his voice filled all his surroundings [...] [pg. 150-151]


Houji per wikipedia:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houji

Houji (Chinese: 后稷, p Hòujì) was a legendary Chinese culture hero credited with introducing millet to humanity during the time of the Xia dynasty.[1] (Millet was the original staple grain of northern China, prior to the introduction of wheat.) His name translates directly as Lord of Millet and was a posthumous name bestowed on him by King Tang, the first of the Shang dynasty.
Houji was credited with developing the philosophy of Agriculturalism and with service during the Great Flood in the reign of Yao; he was also claimed as the ancestor of the Ji clan that became the ruling family of the Zhou dynasty.

Houji's original name was Qi (棄, lit. "the Abandoned One").

Two separate versions of his origin were common. In Chinese mythology, he was said to have been supernaturally conceived when his mother Jiang Yuan, a previously barren wife of the emperor Ku, stepped into a footprint left by Shangdi, the supreme sky god of the early Chinese pantheon.[2][3] Other accounts simply make him one of Ku's four sons, each prophesied to father a family of emperors over China. This origin allowed his descendents to claim a lineage from the Yellow Emperor as well.[4]
He was held to have been repeatedly abandoned by his mother, but saved each time – in the street, by draft animals; in the forest, by woodcutters; on the ice, by a great bird.[3] He later became famous for his luxuriant crops of beans, rice, hemp, gourds, and several kinds of millet and was credited with the introduction of the spring ritual sacrifice of fermented millet beer, roasted sheep, and the herb southernwood.[3]



pg. 151-153

Another legend says that when Jiang was still a young girl, one snowy day in winter she went to the threshing ground to fetch some firewood.  The snow was so heavy that she could hardly walk.  Then she found 2 lines of huge footprints along the road where she should go, and she stepped in them.  Because the footprints were made by a god, she got pregnant by stepping in them.  When she was ready to give birth and was going to be brought to bed in her home, her mother made her ride a mule and go tot he field to give birth since she felt shamed by her daughter's pregnancy.  When the baby was ready to appear, the mule also happened to be ready to give birth.  Worried that this might distrub her own childbirth, Goddess Jiang used a gold needle to block the mule's birth canal.  From then on the mule could no longer bear offspring.  When the baby came out, she threw it into a pool.  It was in June, but the pool water suddenly iced up.  While the baby lay on the ice, birds flew over to cover and warm him.  Since that time, the pool would ice up every June.  Meanwhile, Jiang's sister-in-law sent a pot of dough drop soup to the field, but the pot was broken halfway there, and teh soup flowed down a local hillside, so it later was called "the Hillside of Dough Drop Soup."  Believing that Jiang's miraculous conception woudl bring misfortune to the village, some of her neighbors chased after her and tried to beat her.  Goddess Jiang ran away.  When they had almost caught her, there suddenly came a gale that blew for three days.  When the gale stopped, the people found that Goddess Jiang had disappeared and that a mausoleum appeared in her place.  They called the building "Jiang Yuan's Mausoleum".  

A mausoleum is an external free-standing building constructed as a monument enclosing the interment space or burial chamber of a deceased person or people.

Jingwei

Jingwei is a mythical bird that metamorphosed from yan Di's daughter and indomitably tried to fill up the sea with pebbles.

Yan Di, the Flame Emperor, had a young daughter named Nu Wa (different from teh great mother and cosmic repairer Nuwa; nu means "female", wa means "child").  Nu Wa was playing in the eastern sea, but was fatally drowned and never returned.  She turned into a bird called Jingwei.  Jingwei lived on Fajiu Mountain, located in the north.  It looked like crow but had a colorful head, white beak, and red clars.  Its name is derived from the sound of its call, which sounds like "jingwei".  It always carried a pebble or a twig in its mouth, and dropped it into the eastern sea, where Nu Wa lost her young life.  Jingwei tried unyieldingly to fill up the vast sea with its tiny efforts, never stopping.  

In one version, Jingwei was said to have mated with a sea swallow.  Their female children looked much like Jingwei, and the male children looked mcuh like the sea swallow.  Because Jingwei was drowned in teh eastern sea in its preexistence, it swore not to drink the water of the eastern sea.  Thus it was also called Oath Bird.  And since it had not yet received revenge for its grudge and resentment, Jingwei was also called the Grudge Bird.  Sometimes it is called the Resolve Bird.

Kuafu

Kuafu is the grandson of Houtu.
Kuafu was the mythical hero who chased the sun to compete with it in a race but died of thirst in the end.  His walking stick then transformed into a forest of peach trees.


pg. 156

There was a mountain called Chengdu Zaitian in the great wilderness.  A god named Kuafu lived in it.  There were 2 yellow snakes circling his ears and another 2 yellow snakes in his hands.  He was the grandson of Houtu.  Kuafu overvalued his own strength, so he wanted to chase the sun's shadow and catch the sun at Yugu (Yu Valley).  He felt very thirsty halfway there, so he decided to drink from teh river.  Since the river water was not enough for him, he then decided to go to the great marsh. But he died of thirst on his way.  

Another text from teh same book states that Kuafu competed with teh sun in a race.  He entere dinto the aureole of the sun.  Being very thirsty, he went to drink in the Yellow River and the Wei River, but they were not enough for him.  Then he decided to go northward to the great marsh.  He died of thirst before he arrived there.  His walking stick transformed into a forest of peach trees.  Another version appearing in Liezi [text] adds that after Kuafu died of thirst in his race witht eh sun, he abandoned his walking stick.  Hourished by teh fat from his corpse, the stick turned into a peach tree forest, whcih extended for thousands of miles.  

Kuafu was a man who lived at the shore of the east sea.  He was good at walking and running very fast.  he was familiar with teh sunrise, but wondered how it set, so he took a stick and chased the sun.  When he ran to this mountain (Mount Kuafu), he was so thirsty that he died there.  

Another modern myth says that Kuafu died of anger rather than thirst.  He knew how the sun rose, but wanted to know how the Sun set, so he chased after the sun to have a look.  During the chase, he ran to this mount (Mount Kuafu) and he was thirsty, drank some water and took a nap.  When he awoke, he saw that the sun was just about to set.  Realizing that he could not catch up with the sun, he was extremely angry and at last died of anger. 

[rluu:  Is this saying that when a planet goes retrograde, the cycle death comes?  So is retrograde equal to anger?  Maybe not, because the celebration is a specific time of the year.]

In every lunar October (some versions say February), villagers in Kuafu Valley would offer sacrifices and perform local operats for him.  The fair usually lasted for 3 to 5 days.

Kui is the one-legged mythical monster kileld by Huang Di.  His hide was used to make a drum for Huang Di to defeat Chiyou.  

Kui lived on Mount Liubo (literally "flowing wave") in the east sea.  It looked like an ox but was gray, hornless, and one-legged.  Whenever it came out or dived into the sea, a storm would follow.  Its light was like the sunlight and moonlight, and its sound was like the thunder.  

Later it was caught by Huang Di, who made a drum by using its hide as the cover.  When struck with the bone of the Thunder God, the drum made a great sound that could be heard over 500 miles away.  Huang Di used the drum to show his power ot the whole world.  In some versions, this drum made by Kui's skin played an important role in the battle between Huang Di and Chiyou.  

Other versions depict Kui as a 1-legged horned dragon.  Its scales shone like the sun and moon.  If it happened to be seen, it would bring a drought to the place where it was seen.  Sometimes Kui was said to look like a monkey with a man's face and had the abilityt o talk.  Kui was also described as a drum-shaped animal with one leg.  It was the spirit of the mountain.  If one called its name, then it could help one to catch the tiger and panther.

Qi

Qi was the founder of the Shang people and the son of Di Ku.
Qi was miraculously born by Jiandi after she ingested a swallow's egg adn became pregnant.  

According to text Shiji:
Qi's mother was Jiandi, who was the 2nd concubine of Di Ku.  One day Jiandi went out to take a bath with Di Ku and another person [rluu: 3 people total?] , and she saw a swallow dropping an egg.  She picked it up and swallowed it.  Then she inexplicably became pregnant and later gave birth to Qi.  When Qi grew up, he helped Yu restrain the great flood.  As a result, he was bestowed the fief of Shang by the sage king Shun.  Later he and his state became very powerful and prosperous.  

According to another version in the Shiyiji text:
At the beginning of the Shang dynasty, a divine woman named Jiandi traveled in teh field.  She found a black bird dropping its only egg.  There were two colorful words written on it: "800".  Jiandi picked it up, covered it with a red silk belt, and protected it under a jade basket.  During that night, she dreamed that a mother goddess told her, "You possesss this egg, adn thus you will give birth to a great son.  He will inherit the emblem of Metal".  (according to the theory of 5 elements, the Shang dynasty belongs to metal, "jin").  Jiandi then held the egg to her bosom.  After one year, she became pregnant.  After 14 more months, she gave birth to Qi, the founder of the Shang dynasty.  As the goddess predicted, teh Shang dynasty lasted for 800 years.  

Other versions say that Qi was so distinctive and extraordinary, like Yu and Houji, that when he was born, he came out from his mother's back, or breast, instead of her belly.

Shennong

Shennong is one of the 3 Divine Sovereigns along with Fuxi and Huang Di (names differ according to texts; some groups include the goddess Nuwa).  

The name "shen" means "divine" or "sacred", and "nong" means "farmer".  Therefore he can be called the Divine Farmer.


Accomplishments: 

He is a popular culture hero who started agriculture, Chinese medicine, the market, the Zhaji Sacrificial Rite, and also invented many farm tools and musical instruments. 


At the end of the Warring States era, Shennong was confused with another renowned god, Yan Di.  An example of this confusion can be found in "Shiben" txt.  The two gods were mixed together to make a new prominent god named Yan Di Shennongshi.  This combination is fairly loose, and it influences the Shennong myth less than it does the Yan Di myth.  

Yan Di gradually takes Shennong's basic mythological functions as his won.  Thus Yan Di shows up in later tradition not only as a God of the South and Spring, the half brother of Huang who fought against Huang Di at Banquan, but also as the God of Agriculture and Medicine by teh title Yan Di Shennongshi.  



Shennong is often portrayed as having a head of a dragon or sometime sthe head of an ox.  One myth states that SHennong's mother was Shaodian's wife (here we can find elements of the Yan Di myth mixed together with teh Shennong myth).  Her name was Andeng (or Nudeng in other versions).  One day, when she played in Huayang, a divine dragon copulated with her at the place of Changyang.  She became pregnant and later gave birth to Shennong.  Shennong had a human's face and a dragon's head.  He liked to farm very much, so he was called the Divine Farmer.  

Some versions say that when Shennong was born, 9 connecting wells were suddenly and unexpectedly excavated.  if one drew water from one of them, the water in the other 8 wells would ripple.  

Others say that when Shennong was:
      3 days old   : he could talk
after 5 days       : he could walk
      7 days later : he had fully grown teeth
after 3 years      : he knew everything about sowing and reaping.  


One version of his myth appearing in Guanzi (chapter 64) holds that Shennong taught peopel to sow and to grow grain.

Another version in the same book (chapter 84) maintains that Shennong planted grain to the south of Mount Qi.  From then on, people around the world began to understand the uses of grain and used grain for subsistence.  

According to text from Huainanzi (chapter 19), Shennong taught people to sow the 5 grains.

pg. 192

According to Xinyu text, it states that in ancient times peopel took flesh and blood as their food and drink, and raw animal fur as their cloth.  When it came to Shennong's time, things began to chnge.  Shennong felt that it was very hard for humans to live on reptiles and beasts.  So he went out to look for better food.  He tasted the fruits of hundreds of plants and grasses and recognized their sour or bitter flavors.  After this process, he then taught people to take the 5 grains as their food.  

He invented the calendar and "jieqi".  (According to the Chinese lunar calendar, teh solar year can be divided into 24 seasonal divisions, referred to as "jieqi", which indicate hte change of climate and timing for agricultural activities.  They are of great significance to agriculture and are still widely used in rural areas in China.  

pg. 193

Shennong's other contribution is that he created Chinese medicine.  

Shennong once consumed 70 poisonous plants in one day.  According ot a text from Shoushenji, Shennong thrashed hundreds of herbs with a reddish-brown whip.  

A text in Shuyiji states taht the tripod caldron that Shennong used to taste medicine could be found on the Shenfugang (literally meaning the "Sacred Cauldron Hill") of Taiyuan.  On Mount Chengyang, there is a place where Shennong purportedly whipped the herbs.  The spot came to be known as "Shennong Plain" and the mountain was sometimes called "Mount Medicinal Herb"

Shennong is also credited with inventing the Zhaji Sacrificial Rite (later it was called the Laji Rite), which was held at the end of each year in order to thank all teh gods for enabling the harvest and to pray for another godo harvest in the coming year.  

He taught people to plant mulberry and hemp trees.  People could then make clothes from cloth and silk.  

He made the bow and arrow, adn the whole world was shocked by them.  

Shennong invented some of the most important ancient Chinese musical instruments, such as qin (7-stringed plucked instrument), and se (25-stringed plucked instrument).  

He created the 64 diagrams for divination.  

He also started a market for trading -- he told all peopel to come to a certain place at midday with items that they could exchange for others.  


"Shennong's time" came to become a symbol of the ideal dynasty and golden era in mythical ancient Chinese history.  This era was thoguht to be happy, peaceful, stable, and self-sufficient.  According to text Zhuangzi, the Shennong era was so fantastic that when people slept, they were very quiet; when they were awake, they were happy.  They only knew their mother, and had no idea of their father.  They lived alongside elk.  They sowed and then ate; they weaved and then were clothed.  They never thought of doing harm to others, which was the best virtue.  

pg. 195

A more modern myth from the 1970's: When humans first populated the earth, they did not know how to cook.  They always ate raw animals and plants, so they often became isck.  Shennong wanted to help them.  He decided to taste everything he saw and identify what peopel could take as food and what they could use as drugs to cure their diseases.  So he carried 2 bags along with him.  He put those plants that could function as food in the left bag, and those plants that could function as medicine int eh right bag.  Shennong was very uncommon because he had a crystal stomach and he could see clearly every thing and every change in his internal organs.  

1st plant:  The first plant he tasted was a piece of green leaf.  After he ate it, he found that it cleaned everything up and down in his stomach.  Since it went up and down in his internal organs like it was going on a tour of inspection, Shennong named it "cha" (literally meaning "inspection").  People later incorrectly called it "cha" (meaning "tea"; the same phonetic sound, but with a different character).  Shennong put tea into his left bag.  

2nd plant: Next he tasted a piece of licorice (Glycyrrhiza).  He put it in his right bag.  

3rd plant: He tasted a small green flower.  It was bitter and sour.  When it came into his stomach, Shennong found that it butted everywhere and his knees became swollen.  He hurried to consume some tea and was detoxified.  Thus he found another medicine, the Achyranthes root. 

In this way, Shennong tasted hundreds of herbs and was poisoned almost every day, and the tea always helped him to be detoxified.  Day by day, the plants and herbs in his two bags greatly increased.  

There were  47,000 plants [functioning as food]     in the left bag.
There were 398,000 plants [functioning as medicine] in the right bag.  

One day, Shennong tasted a yellow flower.  As soon as he swallowed it, he watched his intestine break into pieces.  He died before he was able to make some tea.  Later this herb was popularly known as Duanchangcao, the Intestine-breaking Weed. 

pg. 196

Story of Shennong, Ginger and white gourd:

In the ancient past, ginger was extremely poisonous.  If one touched it, one's hand would decay; if one smelled it, one's nose would rot.  All peopel therefore hated it.  whenever they found it, they would dig it up and place it in the sun to die.  Because of this, ginger was almost extinct.  It fled from here to there, tryng to escape being dug out of the ground.  One day, ginger fled to a garden.  It found many plants flourishing, and an old farmer was irrigating the garden.  Ginger admired thos garden plants very much, so it asked a white gourd who the old farmer was.  The white gourd said that it was Shennong, and it was he who dug them from teh wild an dplanted them in teh garden and took watchful care of them.  They lived there happily along with many of their family members.  Ginger then complained to Shennong of his injustice for not collecting it as well.  Shennong asked ginger its function.  When he learned that could do nothing except poison people, Shennong disliked it too.  He wanted to step on ginger and exterminate it.  Ginger was smart.  It quickly went into the ground.  As it did this, it lost all of its poison.  After a half a year (0.5 year), Shennong found a new seedling in the garden.  He tasted a piece of it.  It tasted a little hot.  He felt pleased that he had found a new plant that could detoxify and produce heat, and could be used as both food and medicine.  From then on, ginger became a companion to humans an it was able to stay with many of its family members in the garden.  


pg. 196

Story of Shennong and the ladder from the Shennongjia area:
("jia" means "ladder"; the name Shennongjia came from a legend that Shennong set up a rattan ladder and climbed onto a high mountain to gather herbs;  later the rattan ladder turned into a vast primitive forest, which was called Shennongjia).  


pg. 196-197

Story of Shennong and plagues:

This story states that Emperor Sehnnong is also named Yan Di.  He was the son of Shaodian and Andeng.  Since he grew up on Lie Mountain, he was also called Lieshanshi.  He taught people to cultivate land and rear silkworms.  During his time, peopel suffered greatly from plagues.  To cure the plagues, Sehnnong went into mountains and forests to look for medicines.  He tasted hundreds of herbs.  He met 72 poisonous plants, and he neutralized these poisons himself by consuming 72 other plants and herbs.  So he gathered these helpful herbs to cure people's diseases.  However, there were 36 or 37 poisonous plants that fled into deep forests.  That is why today poisonous plants are more likely to be found in mountains and forests while good herbs are found in the plains.  After he cured the plagues he went on to seek the 5 grains.  

[rluu: Numbers 72 poisonous, 72 herbs, 36 or 37 poisonous, 5 grains.]


pg. 197-198

Poem/story with all important stories about Shennong are compounded and combined into an integrated full story:

Shennong climbed onto mount Yangtou,
He looked carefully, he examined carefully,
Then he found a seed of millet.
He left it with the Chinese date tree,
And he went to open up a wasteland.  
He planted the seed 8 times,
Then it produced fruit.
And from then on humans were able to eat millet.
He sought for the rice seed on Mount Daliang,
The seed was hiding in grasses.  
he left it with teh willow tree,
And he went to open up a paddy field.
He planted the seed 7 times,
Then it produced fruit.
And from then on humans were able to eat rice.  
He sought from teh adzuki bean seed,
And left it with a plum tree.
He planted it 1 time.
The adzuki bean was easy to plant and was able to grow in infertile fields.
The soybean was produced on Mount Weishi,
So it was difficult for Shennong to get its seeds.
He left 1 seed of it with a peach tree,
He planted it 5 times,
Then it produced fruit,
and later tofu was able to be made south of the Huai River.
Barley and wheat were produced on Mount Zhushi,
Shennong was pleased that he got 2 seeds of them.
He left them witha  peach tree,
And he planted them 12 times,
The later peopel were able to eat pastry food.
He sought the sesame seed on Mount Wuzhi,
He left the seed with brambles.
He planted it 1 time.
Then later peopel were able to fry dishes in sesame oil.
Shennong planted the 5 grains and they all survived,
Because they were helped by the 6 species of trees.
Shennong taught people to trade,
Then people received convenience by the way of barter.
Shennong cut wood and made the plough to till,
And that started agriculture...
Shennong established his capital at Chenzhou,
Which was Chouzhou City in Henan Province.
He was on the throne for 140 years,
And he died at Chalin County, Changsha City in Hunan Province.


In the above poem, Shennong is not only identified with Yan Di, the son of Shaodian and Andeng (or, alternatively, Nudeng), but the last paragraph about him suggests that he is also confused with another famous god, Fuxi, who founded the capital of his mythical kingdom in Chenzhou, now the Huaiyang County in Henan Province.  

[rluu: It appears poem above encapsulates an entire cycle.  I should keep this nearby in my studies of TTTA.]

[rluu: See my spreadsheet notes of seeds, trees, times planted, etc. from this story.]


Every lunar April 8, a big festival is held to commemorate Yan Di Shennong.

Birthday of Shennong is lunar April 26.  Festivals are usually held on this day in his temples to celebrate his birthday.  [There is a more formal ritual and offering of sacrifice for Shennong].

[rluu: For April 26: 26th of the lunar month is 15 + 11, or Krishna Ekadashi.]

Xiwangmu

She was owner of the elixir of immortality and the divine peaches that can endow longevity on one who eats them.  

pg. 219

The Xiwangmu myth appears early in the book Shanhaijing, which depicts Xiwangmu as a wild and fearsome spirit whose gender is quite unclear.  Many Chinese scholars maintain that Xiwangmu's image in Shanhaijing illustrates that she possessed both female and male features.  

One account (chap. 2) describes Xiwangmu as a deity of disaster, disease, and punishment.  She dwelled ont eh Jade Mountain, which is very close to Kunlun Mountain, the erthly residence of Supreme Divinity and a paradise for deities and immortals.  She looked like a human but had a panther's tail and tiger's teeth.  She was good at roaring, and wore a jade 'sheng' on her head.  Many Chinese scholars interpret sheng to be a hair ornament, but some argue that wearing a sheng meant "cutting off the animal's hide and wearing it".  Sheng can also be interpreted as a speial part of a loom, which illustrates Xiwangmu's original connection with sericulture.  

In another text from Shanhaijing (chapt. 12), Xiwangmu leans against a small table, wearing a jade sheng on her head.  To the south of her, 3 green birds were fetching food for her (in some versions, a single 3-legged crow fetched her food).  They were all situated north of Kunlun Mountain.  

Another text of the same book (chapt. 16) states that Kunlun Mountain was located south of the west sea, on teh shore of Liusha, behind the Red River and in front of the Black River.  The Weak River (whose water was so weak that it could not float even a feather) circled the bottom of the mountain, and a flaming mountain surrounded it.  A spirit dwelledin the mountain.  It was a human-headed creature with a tiger's body and white spotted tail.  Xiwangmu inhabited a cave there.  She wore a sheng and had tiger's teeth and a panther's tail.  


She became a popularly known keeper of the exlixir of immortality, which ahs the magic power of keeping one's vitality and preventing death.  A well-known myth about the elixir is the story fo Yi and Chang'e.  

Story of Yi and Chang'e: In the early Han book Huainazi, the hero Yi is said to have asked for the elixir of immortality from Xiwangmu, and she gave it to him.  But his wife Chang'e stole it, then flew to the moon and became the spirit of the moon.  

pg. 220

In the Han dynasty, Xiwangmu is popualrly depicted to have a consort named Dongwanggong, King Father of the East.  According to a tet in Shenyijing, there was a bronze pillar on Kunlun Mountain.  It was so big and high that it reached the sky.  In fact, it was a pillar of the sky.  On top of it there was a huge bird named Xiyou (literally meaning "rare").  Opening its left wing, it covered Dongwanggong;  opening the right one, it covered Xiwangmu.  When Xiwangmu met Dongwanggong, she had to climb onto its wing.  In another account, Dongwanggong lived in a big stone house on the East Wild Mountain.  He was about 10 feet high, and his hair was as white as snow.  He looked like a man but had a bird's face and a tiger's tail.  he rode a black bear.  With a Jade Maiden he often played a game by throwing chips into a pot.  When he threw chips into the pot, heaven sighed; when he failed, heaven laughed.  

pg. 221

In inscriptions on bronze mirrors from this era, Xiwangmu's and Dongwanggong's names frequently appear together.  

On funerary stones and brick bas-reliefs, Xiwangmu is sometimes shown alone, and someties she is accompanied by Dongwangggong.  She is typically shown as a respectable goddess, sitting on a cloud or a seat made of a dragon and a tiger.  She is often surrounded by Jade Rabbit, a toad, birds, or sometimes a 3-legged crow, a deer, a dragong, a 9-tailed fox, and immortal servants with wings.  The rabbit (sometimes the immortal servants also) usually is pounding the elixir in a mortar in front of Xiwangmu and Dongwanggong.  


She also is widely knwon as the owner of the divine saucer peach, a fruit that has the magic power of endowing longevity.  She gave four saucer peaches to the emperor (who reigned from 156 to 87 BC).  Since the peaches tasted so good, the emperor kept the pits, hoping to plant them when he came back to the central land.  But Xiwangmu told him that this kind of peach needed to be harvested for 3,000 years before yielding ripe peaches.  The emperor felt disappointed and gave up.  

After the tang and Song dyansties, Xiwangmu becomes more common in folk tradition.  She often appears in a later-formed pantheon (far from orderly and stable) as the consort of Yu Di, the Jade Emperor, the highest ruler of heaven adn gods.  one of their daughters is the famous Zhi Nu, or Weaving Maiden.  In legends she is said to secretly descend to the world and marry a cowherd.  Her mother felt quite annoyed so she pulled out her hairpin and made a line in the air.  The line then turned into the Milky Way that divided the lovers on teh two sides  of the shore.  From then on, on every lunar July 7, the lovers were allowed to meet each other.  Magpies would fly over to make the bridge fro them.  

pg. 221-222

In a renowned mythic novel Xiyouji ("Journey to the West"), Xiwangmu is addressed as Wangmu Niangniang, the bearer of peaches that gave immortality to whoever ate them.  She often invited other immortals and gods to Saucer Peach Banquet.  The peaches she used for the banquet were classified into 3 sorts:

1) The first one ripened every 3,000 years and could make the person who ate it healthy.
2) The second one ripened every 6,000 years and could bring the one who ate it a long life.
3) The third one ripened every 9,000 years and could make the one who ate it as long-lived as heaven and the earth.

In the novel, the Monkey King ate many of the best peaches and distrubed the banquet because he was not invited.  

pg. 222-223

A myth collected in 1986 in a village of Zhongning County, Ningxia Province, northwest China, attributes the contribution of repairing the broken sky and the earth to Wangmu Niangniang and Lishan Laomu (who sometimes is identified as Nuwa).  It holds that Wangmu Niangniang was Lishan Laomu's younger sister.  Both of them were good helpers of their elder brother Fuxi.  One year, Gonggong fought Zhurong and destroyed the sky pillar mount Buzhou.  The sky then tilted towards the Northwest, the earth was damaged at the Southeast, and flood-water overflowed everywhere.  The two sisters felt sympathetic to humans and decided to repair the damaged sky and earth.  They gathered and melted stones of 5 different colors to patch the sky at the site of Mount Li (now in Shaanxi Province).  The firelight they made was absorbed by the sun.  Thus it could illuminate the world with sunlight.  The fire also melted ice on the earth, so it became a hot spring.  The sisters cooperated to accomplish the huge project.  Wangmu Niangniang took care of the fire while Lishan Laomu kneaded the stone paste adn made numerous stone cakes.  She then struck them in the broken sky.  To prevent the stone cakes from falling down fromt eh sky, Lishan Laomu cut the legs off a huge tortoise and set them up to support the 4 extremities of the sky.  Wangmu Niangniang then used the ashes to fill in the flaws on the earth.  After their arduous labor, the world was restored again.  After they died, people built a temple at Mount Li to commemorate their tremendous accomplishment.  


pg. 224

At Tai Mountain in Shandong Province can be found a temple complex named Wangmu Pool.  Most of it was built during the Qing dynasty.  Every lunar March 3, a Saucer Peach Festival is held to celebrate Wangmu Niangniang's birthday.  

[rluu: Lunar March 3 is Wangmu Niangniang's birthday.  
       It is celebrated as "Saucer Peach Festival"]

Gonggong
Also known as Kanghui.

Gonggong is the water god who caused a flood disaster and bumped into Mount Buzhou, giving rise to cosmic disorder.  

He is often portrayed as having a man's head with red hair, and the body of a serpent.  

From poem Tianwen:
"Why did the earth tilt toward the southeast during Kanghui's rage?"

Gonggong is said to have fought with the god Zhuanxu (or Zhurong, Di Ku, or Shengnong; various names are given in different versions) to be the Supreme Divinity in remote times, but he failed. In his fury, he bumped against one of the sky pillars, Mount Buzhou, and damaged it.  The cords of the earth also broke during this event.  his blunder brought cosmic disruption.  


According to "Lunheng" and "Bu shiji Sanhuang Benji" (Biographies of the Tree Sovereigns: A Supplement to the Historical Records"), the Gonggong story is followed by that of Nuwa.  Gonggong was described as a rebllious nobleman.  He ruled with tyranny instead of benevolence.  Toward the end of Nuwa's reign, Gonggong fought with Zhurong, the God of Fire, but he failed.  He was so angry that he struck his head against Mount Buzhou and caused this sky pillar to collapse, snapping the cords of the earth.  To repair this damage, Nuwa melted stones of 5 different colors to mend the sky.  She cut off the legs off a huge tortoise and set them up to support the 4 corners of the sky.  Then she colletected ashes of reeds to stop the flood.  Through her effort, Nuwa cleared up the chaos and put hte world in order again.

According to texts "Liezi" and "Bowuzhi", the chronological order of these two stories is reversed.  That is, Nuwa repaired a defect in teh cosmos first, and later Gonggong fought with the god Zhurong and upset the normal established order.  Gonggong's damage often served as an etiological myth of the current Chinese topography.  Since then, heaven tils toward the Northwest, adn that is why the sun, moon, and stars move in that direction.  Earth sinks toward the southeast, and that is why the rivers of China flow toward the ocean in the east.  

Gongong is not only the destroyed of the sky pillar cords of the earth but also plays a chief role in a disasterous flood.  

Another version from Huainazi (chapt. 8), the Gongong story is linked with that of the mythical sovereigns Shun and Yu.  In Shun's time, Gonggong created a flood that swept near the place of Kongsang.  At that time, the mountains Longmeng (meaning "Dragon Gate") and Luliang did not open up and hence blocked the channels.  So the flood spread everywhere, and rivers throughout the land joined together.  People had to climb the mountains and trees to escape from teh vast deluge.  Then shun ordered Yu to dredge teh rivers and lakes, open up the waterways, and channel the flood to the east sea.  As a result, the flood ran out and the world became dry, and people became settled again.

After his failure, Gonggong came to a sticky end.  One version of the myth states that he was killed by the god Zhuanxu because he created the flood idsaster.  Other verisons state that he was killed by Di Ku or Yao because of his tyranical and conceited domination.  A popular story says that he was banished by Yu when Yu brought an end to the flood.  But other variants state that Gonggong was exiled to the place of Youzhou by Shun, or, in another version, by Yao because Yao wanted to give the throne to Shun but Gonggong opposed this.

Khulong ("Torch shaddow" or "torch dragon")

Zhulong (Chinese: 燭龍; pinyin: zhúlóng; Wade–Giles: chu-lung; literally "torch dragon") or Zhuyin (Chinese: 燭陰; pinyin: zhúyīn; Wade–Giles: chu-yin; literally "illuminating darkness", or "Torch Shadow") was a giant red draconic solar deity in Chinese mythology. It supposedly had a human's face and snake's body, created day and night by opening and closing its eyes, and created seasonal winds by breathing.


[rluu: His body is 1000 leagues long.]
[rluu: He is scarlet color.]
[rluu: He enlightens the 9 yin (darknesses, 9 directions)]



"The Classic of Regions Beyond the Seas: The North" section (8) describes Zhuyin 燭陰 on Mount Zhong 鍾山.

    The deity of Mount Bell is named Torch Shade. When this deity's eyes look out there is daylight, and when he shuts his eyes there is night. When he blows it is winter, and when the calls out it is summer. He neither drinks, nor eats, nor breathes. If this god does breathe, there are gales. His body is a thousand leagues long. Torch Shade is east of the country of Nolegcalf. He has a human face and a snake's body, and he is scarlet in colour. The god lives on the lower slopes of Mount Bell. (tr. Birrell 2000:121)

Visser (1913:62-3) renders Zhuyin as "Enlightener of the Darkness" and translates the commentary of Guo Pu (276-324 CE).

    'Enlightener' is a dragon; he enlightens the nine yin (darknesses, i.e. the nine points of the compass at the opposite, dark side of the earth, which is a flat disk; these nine points are North, South, East, West, North-east, North-west, South-east, South-west, and the Centre)". (tr. Visser 1913:62)

"The Classic of the Great Wilderness: The North" section (17) describes Zhulong 燭龍 living on Mount Zhangwei 章尾山.

    Beyond the northwest seas, north of the River Scarlet there is Mount Brillianttail. There is a god-human here with a human face and a snake's body, and he is scarlet. He has vertical eyes that are in a straight seam. When this deity closes his eyes, there is darkness. When the deity look with his eyes, there is light. He neither eats, nor sleeps, nor breathes. The wind and the rain are at his beck and call. This deity shines his torch over the ninefold darkness. This deity is Torch Dragon. (tr. Birrell 2000:188)

The yin in this jiuyin 九陰 "ninefold darkness" context explains using the "dragon" name Zhulong instead of "darkeness" name Zhuyin. Guo Pu quotes a legend from a no longer extant Shijing commentary (tr. Major 1993:204), "The sky is insufficient to cover the northwest, so there is no ebb and flow of yang and yin. Therefore a dragon carries a torch in its mouth to light up the sky."



The Tianwen 天問 "Heavenly Questions" section (3, cf. Bashe) asks about Zhulong. Compare these translations:

    "What land does the sun not shine on and how does the Torch Dragon light it?" (Hawkes 1985:128)
    "Where does the sun not rise, How does the Torch Dragon flame?" (Field 1986:44)
    "The Torch Dragon flares where the sun does not reach [where? how?]" (Major 1993:203)

The Dazhao 大招 "Great Summons" section (10, tr. Hawkes 1985:234) uses the alternate name Zhuolong 逴龍 or 趠龍 "distant/quarreling dragon": "In the north are the Frozen Mountain, and the Torch Dragon, glaring red."



    Lighting Darkness and Candle-Gleam are on an island in the Yellow River; they illumine an area of one thousand li. The Dragon Gate is in the depths of the Yellow River. … The Torch Dragon dwells north of Wild Goose Gate. He hides himself in Abandoned Wings Mountain and never sees the sun. This god has a human face and a dragon body, but no feet. (tr. Major 1993:196)

The commentary of Gao You 高誘 (ca. 168-212 CE, tr. Major 1993:163) explains, "Weiyu is the name of a mountain … in the shade of the northern limit, the sun cannot be seen." Mount Weiyu 委羽, notes Major, might mean "abandoned wings," "broken wings," "shed feathers," or something else.


The Dongmingji 洞冥記 "Record of Penetrating the Mysteries", which describes ritual activities of Emperor Wu of Han (r. 141-87 BCE), is traditionally attributed to Guo Xian 郭憲 (fl. 25-57 CE) but probably dates (Smith 2008:368) from around the 6th century. Although this text does not mention Zhuyin or Zhulong, Wu's Daoist advisor Dongfang Shuo describes a mythical northern qinglong 青龍 "Azure Dragon" with a zhu 燭 "torch".

    … in the year 99 before our era the emperor Wu convoked a meeting of magicians and learned men, at which Tung Fang-soh spoke as follows: "I made a journey to the north pole, and came to a mountain planted with fire, which neither the sun, nor the moon ever illumines, but which is lighted to its uttermost bounds by a blue dragon by means of a torch which it holds in its jaws. I found in that mountain gardens, fields, and parks with ponds, all studded with strange trees and curious plants, and with shrubs which had luminiferous stalks, seeming at night to be lamps of gold. These stalks could be broken off and used as torches, in the light of which the spectres were visible. Ning-fung, the immortal had always eaten this plant, the consequence being that in the darkness of the night there beamed light out of his belly. It is called the herb which pierces darkness. (tr. Groot 1910 6:1167)

This namesake torch-like plant is called dongmingcao 洞冥草 "penetrating the mysteries herb".

Alternate story of Nuwa.

Appearance in Fengshen Yanyi

Nüwa is featured within the famed Ming dynasty novel Fengshen Bang. As featured within this novel, Nüwa is very highly respected since the time of the Xia Dynasty for being the daughter of the Jade Emperor; Nüwa is also regularly called the "Snake Goddess". After the Shang Dynasty had been created, Nüwa created the five-colored stones to protect the dynasty with occasional seasonal rains and other enhancing qualities. Thus in time, Shang Rong asked King Zhou of Shang to pay her a visit as a sign of deep respect. After Zhou was completely overcome with lust at the very sight of the beautiful ancient goddess Nüwa (who had been sitting behind a light curtain), he would write a small poem on a neighboring wall and take his leave. When Nüwa later returned to her temple after visiting the Yellow Emperor, Nüwa would see the foulness of Zhou's words. In her anger, she swore that the Shang Dynasty will end in payment for his foulness. In her rage, Nüwa would personally ascend to the palace in an attempt to kill the king, but was suddenly struck back by two large beams of red light.


After Nüwa realized that King Zhou was already destined to rule the kingdom for twenty-six more years, Nüwa would summon her three subordinates—the Thousand-Year Vixen (later becoming Daji), the Jade Pipa, and the Nine-Headed Pheasant. With these words, Nüwa would bring destined chaos to the Shang Dynasty, "The luck Cheng Tang won six hundred years ago is dimming. I speak to you of a new mandate of heaven which sets the destiny for all. You three are to enter King Zhou's palace, where you are to bewitch him. Whatever you do, do not harm anyone else. If you do my bidding, and do it well, you will be permitted to reincarnate as human beings." Thus, with these words, Nüwa would never be heard of again, but would still be a major indirect factor towards the Shang Dynasty's fall.


[Summary number components:

  Nuwa ascended to the palace and saw 2 beams of red light.

  King Zhou to rule the kingdom for 26 more years.

  3 subordinates of Nuwa summoned:
    - 1000-year Vixen (later becoming Daji)
    - The Jade Pipa
    - The 9-headed Pheasant.

  It is 600 years since Cheng Tang began his luck.  His luck to dim.
