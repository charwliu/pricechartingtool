Di Ku rides a dragon in the Spring and Summer.
Di Ku rides a horse  in the Fall and Winter.

Di Ku is one of the 5 August Emperors.  

Di Ku has 2 sons that fought every day and became star gods:
1) Ebo: Got moved to Shangqiu and assigned charge fo the Chen star.
2) Shichen: Got moved to Daxia and assigned charge of the Shen star.

[rluu: Implicatino from my reading is that these stars were at opposite sides of the circle.  Is this 2 pentagons inverted in each other?]



Qi means "the Abandoned".  [rluu: Sounds like Moses.]


Di Ku had 4 consorts:

1) Jiang Yuan: Gave birth to Houji, the god of grain and agriculture, by stepping in a giant toe-print in a field.  
[rluu: I think Houji is connected to Tammuz (Hebrew) and Dumuzi (Sumerian).
    Dumuzid of Bad-tibira, the shepherd (reigning 36 000 years), the fifth King before the Flood.
    Dumuzid of Kuara, the fisherman (reigning 100 years), the third King of the first dynasty of Uruk, reigning between Lugalbanda and Gilgamesh.
]



2) Jiandi:     Gave birth to Qi by swallowing a [colorful] swallow egg.  (there were 2 eggs in some stories).  

3) Qingdu:     Gave birth to Di Yao (Emperor Yao), the 1st of the 3 sage kings.

4) Changyi:    Gave birth to Di Zhi (Emperor Zhi), who inherited Di Ku's crown but resigned and handed over the crown to his brother Yao after 9 years.  



A black dragon caused the deludge.  This flood could not be stopped until the goddess Nuwa defeated and killed the dragon.  [pg. 105]

Center: Female monkey with 3 heads and 6 arms.

Creation story of humans: 

They often visited the monkey and had intercourse with her.  Long afterward, the monkey became pregnant.  After 9,900 years, the monkey produced 99 eggs.  However, all the eggs except the biggest one were stolen by the king of the other 4 eareas.  The biggest egg hatched a python.  Confroming to his monkey mother's request, the python departed to look for those eggs stolen by the kings.  He defeated and devoured those birds, beasts, insects, and fishes/shrimp that tried to hinder him along the way.  Therefore his appearance changed completely.  He became a strange winged creature that had a bull's head, deer's horns, pig's mouth, hawk's paws, and snake's trunk.  He had become a devine dragon that could fly up to teh sky and control the wind and rain.  The 4 kings were so scared by the dragon that they returned all teh eggs to him.  The dargon broke the eggs one by one.  Each time he broke na egg, a creature appeared.  But all those creatures ran away from teh dragon.  The only onees who stayed wiht the dragon were hatched from teh last 2 eggs: They were a man and a woman.  It was they who bore human beings in later time.

Pangu was born from the cosmic egg.

At the very beginning, heaven and earth were in chaotic formlessness like a chicken's egg.  Within this chaos Pangu was born.  

Pangu grew up in the egg while shaping heaven & earth
  - Each day heaven rose 10 feet higher.
  - Each day earth grew 10 feet thicker
  - Each day Pangu grew 10 feet taller.

This situation lasted for 18,000 years.
Since he had to twist his body in this egg, eh got his name which means "coil up" + "antiquity".  

After 18,000 years, Pangu shattered the egg into pieces.
Egg white was light so it became heaven.  
Yolk was heavy so it became earth.
Shell pieces was mixed into the egg white and yolk:
  - Shell pieces that mixed with egg white [heaven] became the stars.
  - 2 larger shell pieces that mixed with heaven became the Sun and Moon.
  - Shell pieces that mixed with yolk      [earth]  became the stones.


pg, 176-178

This gives different variants of the story.

18,000 years Pangu was in the egg, before it was hatched.
Then 18,000 years of expansion:
  - Each day heaven rose 10 feet higher.
  - Each day earth grew 10 feet thicker
  - Each day Pangu grew 10 feet taller.
Then appeared the 3 Sovereigns.


Some versions say that Pangu cut the connection between heaven adn the earth with an adze and chisel.  In order to keep heaven and earth from merging again after he separated them, Pangu himself served as a huge pillar by standing between them.


Pangu's body transformed into the universe after his death:
Breath : winds and clouds
Voice : thunder
Left eye: Sun
Right eye : Moon
Four limbs and trunk : 4 Extremes of the earth and the 5 Mountains.
Blood : Rivers
Veins : Earth's arteries
Flesh : Fields and soil.
Hair and beard : Stars
Skin and body hair : plants
Teeth and bones : Metals and rocks.
Semen and marrow : Pearls and jade.
Sweat : Rain and the dew.
Insects on his body reacted to the wind and turned into human beings.


Fair skin = Moon
Glowing skin = Sun


Story about the Mythical cause of Earthquakes.

In order to separate heaven and earth, Pangu asked a god to lift heaven and tried to find another spirit to hold up the earth.  Since earth was very heavey, Pangu molded an ox with clay and his own saliva.  He blew on the clay ox and it became alive.  Then the divine ox was made to carry the earth.

Additionally, Pangu molded a lcay rooster as a supervisor to keep the ox from falling asleep so as to keep the earth from sinking.  

After thousands of years of supporting the earth on its back, the ox felt so tired that it wished to take a nap.  But the rooster insisted on fulfilling Pangu's instruction and did not allow it.  The ox was so annoyed that it shook its head and body 3 times.  As a result, the earth on the back of the ox shook as well.  That is the origin of earthquakes.  


Pangu's appearance is described as having a dragon's head and a serpent's trunk.  In portraits and temple statues, Pangu usually appears as a man-like giant with a horn on his head.    In Pangu's time, all people were horned.  They used the horn as a weapon in hunting.  Moreover, the horn had a very important function of providing a signal at one's time of death.  When a person was dying, his horn would get soft and loose.  Usually people worked very hard at hunting, but a person who felt his horn become soft and loose would cease working to wait for death.  During a later period, there were so many people whose horns got soft and loose that few people were working.  This annoyed the God of Heaven.  He sent divine troops and took back the horn of humankind.  

Every March 3 of the lunar calendar there is a huge temple fair for Pangu.  These activities will last 7 or 8 days, from March 1 to March 7 or 8.  

It typically is only the supreme god, Jade Emperor, that has the right to send rain, but occasionally other gods who have made great contributions to gods or mankind will be given special permission by the Supreme God to create rain several times a year.  Pangu belongs to this group.  


A deity recorded in two texts in Shanhaijing is thought to be the prototype of the Pangu figure.  This deity is called Zhulong ("Torch Dragon") or Zhuyin ("Torch Shadow").  He was a god with a human face and serpent's trunk, and his body was 1,000 miles in length.  When his eyes opened there was daylight and when they closed it became night.  His hard breath made winter and his hot exhalation made summer.  His appearance and abilities are almost hte same as Pangu's.  


[rluu: Pillar might mean something that supports between heaven and earth.]

Gun-Yu flood myth.

Feather mountain (Yushan)

Gun killed by fire god Zhurong.  
3 years the corpse didn't rot.
Belly was opened with a sword, and Yu emerged.
Yu spent 13 years trying to control the flood.
During this period he did not go to his home the 3 time she passed by it.  

Pregnat wife brings Yu food, but Yu is in teh form of a bear.  She runs away and turns into a stone.  Yu shouts to the stone to give back his son.  The stone opens up and out comes Qi (meaning "open up").

The Shang people believe that the founder of Shang, Qi, came from a swallow that was sent down by heaven.  [pg. 35]  [rluu: Is this swallow the same as Jonah/dove?]  Zhou people confirm that their founder, Qi (different from teh Shang's Qi) was born after his mother, Jiang Yuan, stepped into a huge footprint and became pregnant.

Chang'e steals elixir of immortality from Xiwangmu, the Queen mother of the West. Chang'e consumes it, flew to the moon and became the spirit of the moon.  

This happened on the 15th of August in the lunar calendar (full moon).  

At the night of Mid-autumn festival: chinese people offer mooncakes and round fruits in their yard.  It is said they can see Chang'e, cassia tree, and rabbit on this full moon.  

Sometimes the story says Chang'e turns into a frog or toad on the moon and pounds the elixir in a mortar (undlessly). 

Sometimes it is the jade rabbit that is pounding the elixir.  

The Cassia tree in this sotry was 5,000 feet high.  Wu Gang chops the base of the tree, but the tree heals itself immediately.

pg. 92

Chiyou

Chiyou was the offspring of Yan Di (The Flame Emperor), the god of war, and the inventor of military weapons.  He rebelled against Huang Di, but failed int eh war and was killed.  His shackles turned into a maple tree.


According to legend, Chi You had a bronze head with metal foreheads.[1] He had 4 eyes and 6 arms, wielding terrible sharp weapons in every hand.[5] His head was that of a bull with two horns, but the body was that of a human.[5] He is said to have been unbelievably fierce, and to have had 81 brothers.[5] Historical sources often described him as 'cruel and greedy',[4] as well as 'tyrannical'.[6] Some sources have asserted that the figure 81 should rather be associated with 81 clans in his kingdom.[3]

[rluu: Chi You had 81 brothers, each one 4-eyed.]


Some versions say Chiyou had 80 brothers or 71 brothers.  [pg. 140]  Each of them with an animal body, broze head, and iron forehead, who spoke in a human language.  They used sand and stone as their food.  Other versions state that Chiyou took iron and stone as his food and that he had a human body, horned head, ox hooves, 4 eyes, 6 hands, and ears and temples like swords and spears.  



War between Chiyou and Huang Di.

Chiyou is said to have made weapons and attacked Huang Di.  Thus, Huang Di commanded Yinglong to launch an attack against him in the wilderness of the central plain.  Yinglong began by storing all the water.  Chiou asked Feng Bo and Yu SHi to release a cloudburst. Then Huang Di asked the drought goddess Ba to descend from ehaven and stop the rain.  This eventually killed Chiyou.  


One stody states that when Chiyou attacked Huang Di, no one was able to stop him because he butted people with his horns.  In one version, Chiyou was said to be able to saor into the sky and surmount the dangerous and difficult obstructions.  But Huang Di made a drum from teh hide of Kui, a one-legged mythical beast, and beat it many times.  The sound it made was so great that it prevented Chiyou from flying away.  So Chiyou was caught and killed by Huang Di.  

Another version states that Chiyou led many ferocious mythical animals to attack Huang Di at the Zhuolu plain.  So Huang Di ordered his subjects to blow horns sounding like dragons to threaten them.  

Another version said that Chiyou could stir up clouds and mist.  When he fought with huang Di, he made heavy fog for 3 days.  Huang Di's army was caught in it adn could not figure out their direction.  Huang Di then invented the compass and guided his army out of the fog.  Thus, Huang Di defeated Chiyou and killed him.  When Chiyou was executed, his head and body were cut off and buried in different places, and his shackles turned into a maple tree.  

One version of the myth said that many years after Huang Di won the battle and killed Chiyou, teh world became troubled and confused.  In order to deter his people from revolting, Huang Di drew Chiyou's picture and showed it to them, after which the world became peaceful again.  During the Qin and Han dynasties, Chiyou was worshipped as the god of war by teh army leader and even the first emperor of Qin.  



[rluu-TODO: Read more about the Maple Tree.]

pg. 94-95

Chiyou is worshiped as a remote ancestor of the Miao ethnic people.  In Miao mythology, Jiangyang, an ancestor of the Miao people, was born from the egg of a goddess who was born from a maple tree.  They believe that the maple god can expel evils.  In certain areas, a traditional festival called "Trembling the Flower Mountain" is held once a year.  It is said taht this festival originated fromt eh Chiyou mythic event.  After being defeated by Huang Di, Chiyou led his tribes back into the thickly forrested mountains.  In order to call together the scattered people over the mountains, he planted a long trunk with a colorful red waistband on the mountain and asked the young to dance and blow reed pipes around it.  On hearing the sound, people came from all directions.  Chiyou gathered them, and they continued to fight against huang Di.  There is a custom of dancing and blowing reed pipes around a flower-wreathed pole.  The defeat of Chiyou is why the Miao people had to flee from the Central Plain towards the southern mountains.  

pg. 94

Cords of the earth:

Cords are tied to the earth to prevent it from collapsing.  Usually the holder is a divine creature such as a turtle, cow, fish, dragon, or snake.

4 cords tied up to the 4 corners of the square earth.  

In some ancient texts, earth cords were said to have been broken off during a war in the remote past.  

Nuwa melted stones of 5 different colors to repair the defective sky, and cut the legs from a huge tortoise and set them up to suppor thte four extremities of the sky.  

[rluu-TODO: Read the wikipedia article on this.  This is related to the flood and starting over again.]


pg. 95-96

Crow of the Sun.

The crow of the sun functions as the spirit of the sun, or, in some versions, the bearer of the sun across the sky.  

In the great wilderness, there was a huge tree named Fusang (Leaning mulberry) growing on the top of a mountain.  Its trunk reached a height of 300.  Beside the mountain there was a valley named Tang Valley, in which another Fusang tree was growing.  Here was the place from which the 10 suns rose adn set back down.  As soon as one sun came back from its journey crossing the sky, another sun started forth.  Each of the 10 suns was carried by a crow.  

"Why did Yi shoot down teh suns?  Why did the crows shed their feathers?"
This quote cites a paragraph to explain these questions:

At the time of Yao (a demigod and one of the 3 sage kings), the 10 suns rose together and burned up the woods and grass.  Yao then ordered Yi to shoot down the 10 suns in teh sky, and Yi shot down 9 of them.  The 9 crows settling in these suns died, and their feathers fell out.  It seems taht the cros in teh suns, which function as the sun's spirits are in some degree different from those who are bearers of the suns, whose main function is to carry each sun across the sky while they are on duty.  

In some versions, the crow of the sun is sometimes said to be 3-legged.  


[rluu: What is the 6 Dynasties Era?]

There are 2 sorts of mythical grasses of immortality that grew in the Northeast and Southwest:
1) Di Ri      (Di = "ground", ri = "sun")
2) Chun Sheng (chun = "spring", sheng = "grow")

The 3-legged crow liked eating these grasses very much.  It descended from heaven to earth several times in order to eat them.  But Xihe, the mother of the 10 suns, did not like it to do so.  She wanted to control teh crow, so she covered its eyes with her hands to stop it from flying down.  



pg. 97

Di Jun or Emperor Jun.

He is a companion to Xihe, mother of the suns, and a companion to Changxi, mother of the moons.  Many of his descendants are famous culture heroes or demigods.  

"Jun" this' name are found only in the "shanhaiching" ("wilderness", "home in" the two mentioned several times). "Handsome" is the original meaning of "at the top of the Pyramid people". "Jun" a word literally means "at the top of the Pyramid'".



In the Great Wilderness lived a flock of 5-colored birds.  They were dancing in pairs.  The god Di Jun desired to go down tot he earth and make friends with them.  These birds looked after his 2 altars on teh earth.  This story is recorded in chapter 14 in text Shanhaijing; according to a text in chapter 16, the 5-colored bird is a type of phoenix.  

In the story from chapter 18, Di Jun is described as the god who bestowed special power on the archer Yi.  he gave Yi a red bow, and arrows with white feathers, placing Yi on teh earth to help all the countries there.  Therefore Yi started his work of saving people from hardship.  

[rluu: Notice the colors: Red and White.  They are the same colors as the Divine Mercy.]

A text in chapter 17 concerns Di Jun's bamboo forest.  Beyond the northeast seas, in the Great Wilderness around the river, there was a mountain named Mount Fuyu.  Beside the mountain there was a mound.  It was about 300 in circumference.  To the South of the mound lay Di Ku's bamboo forrest.  The bamboo there was so large that just one knot of it could be used to make a boat.  

[rluu: Does this match a mound in the bible?  It sounds like the bamboo here are the Lebonnon cedars?  We get a number "300" from this.]


Di Jun's 2 consorts were Xihe and Changxi.  

Beyond the east sea, and next ot eh Gan Gulf was the kingdom of Xihe.  A lady named Xihe married Di Jun and gave birth to the 10 suns.  She spends her time bathing the suns in the Gan Gulf.

In the Great Wilderness there was a mountain called mount Riyue (Mount Suna dn moon).  It was in the key position of the heavens.  At this mountain there was a lady, Changxi, who waalso was Di Jun's wife.  Changxi had given birth to 12 moons.  In the text, Changxi was just beginning ot bathe them.  

Di Jun's descendants founded the kingsdoms of:
1) Zhongrong
2) Siyou
3) Baimin
4) Heichi
5) Sanshen


They all were extraordinary peopel who possessed special powers, especially the power to control the 4 beasts:
1) Tiger
2) Panther
3) Bear
4) Brown bear.


Di Jun also had 8 sons that created songs and dance.  
[rluu: It's not clear that he only had 8 sons.]

The Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_Sovereigns_and_Five_Emperors

In myth, the three sovereigns were demigods who used their abilities to help create mankind and impart essential skills and knowledge. The five emperors were exemplary sages possessed of great moral character.


The Three Sovereigns, sometimes known as the Three August Ones, were said to be god-kings or demigods who used their magical powers to improve the lives of their people. Because of their lofty virtue, they lived to a great age and ruled over a period of great peace. The Three Sovereigns are ascribed various identities in different Chinese historical texts.

That year, the sun and the moon born from two eyes of Pangu, the stars from his hairs couldn't move smoothly and correctly, which caused many days without sun, or many days with the sun shined all over each day, or many dangerous fallen star accidents. With his power, Dìhuáng corrected the false. He made the sun, the moon move correctly, and stipulated the days of a month, the months of a year.

Dìhuáng`s rule lasted eleven thousand years.

Yellow Emperor:
Battles
Main articles: Battle of Zhuolu and Battle of Banquan

According to traditional accounts, the Yan emperor meets the force of the "Nine Li" (九黎) under their bronze-headed leader, Chi You,[33] and his 81 horned and four-eyed brothers[9] and suffers a decisive defeat. He flees to Zhuolu and begs the Yellow Emperor for help. During the ensuing Battle of Zhuolu the Yellow Emperor employs his tamed animals and Chi You darkens the sky by breathing out a thick fog.[43] This leads the emperor to develop the South Pointing Chariot, which he uses to lead his army out of the miasma.[9][43] He next calls upon the drought demon Nuba to dispel Chi You's storm.[9][43] He then destroys the Nine Li and defeats Chi You[44] before falling out with the Yan emperor, defeating him at Banquan[33] and replacing him as the primary ruler.[35]
Death
Main article: Mausoleum of the Yellow Emperor

The Yellow Emperor was said to have lived for over a 100 years before meeting a phoenix and a qilin and then dying.[1] Two tombs were built in Shaanxi within the Mausoleum of the Yellow Emperor, in addition to others in Henan, Hebei and Gansu.[45]

Modern-day Chinese people sometimes refer to themselves as the "Descendants of Yan and Yellow Emperor"

Upon his death he rose into the heavens and became a Xian (or Hsien), an immortal . 


[rluu: It's not clear how long he lived.]


----------------


Shaohao

Legend says that his mother, a weaver goddess, was a beautiful fairy named Huange who fell in love with the planet Venus while drifting along the Milky Way. The two enjoyed many intimate nights together on her raft and they created a son. She soon gave birth to Shaohao, who grew up to be a handsome young man with a lot of potential. His great uncle, Huang Di, was so impressed with him that he named him God of the Western Heavens.

The myth says that Shaohao created a kingdom in the five mountains of the Eastern Paradise that was inhabited by different types of birds. As the ruler of this bureaucratic land, he captured the identity of a vulture. Other birds worked below him, such as a phoenix as his Lord Chancellor, a hawk that delegated the law, and a pigeon that was in charge of education. He chose the four seasons of the year to watch over the remaining birds.



Although his kingdom was successful for many years, he moved back to the west and left his kingdom of birds to his son Chong. With a different son, Ru Shou, he made his home on Changliu Mountain, where he could rule over the Western Heavens. In union as father and son, they were responsible for the daily setting of the sun. In addition, Shaohao was thought to have introduced China to the twenty-five string lute.


[rluu: number 25]


Preceded by
Yellow Emperor 	Emperor of China
c. 2597 BC – c. 2514 BC 	Succeeded by
Zhuanxu

[rluu: covers a period of rule of 83 years.]


----------------

Zhuanxu led the Shi clan in an eastward migration to present-day Shandong, where intermarriages with the Dongyi clan enlarged and augmented their tribal influences. At age twenty, he became their sovereign, going on to rule for seventy-eight years until his death.

In mythology, Zhuanxu is also mentioned as a Polar Star god and father of Taowu "the Block".


[rluu: 20 + 78 = 98]




----------------

According to speculative dates (calculated after 100 BC by Liu Xin) he is supposed to have ruled from c. 2436 BC to c. 2366 BC, though other dates are also mentioned.

[rluu: if these years are correct, then it is a lifespan of 70 years.]


After achieving the imperial title, Ku was said to travel seasonally by riding a dragon in spring and summer, and a horse in autumn and winter.[6] Among other things, Ku was an inventor of musical instruments and composer of songs. 


According to some traditions, Ku had four sons to four different wives
He is also said to have had two sons who became star gods, Ebo and Shichen.
Sons:
1) Houji
2) Xie
3) Yao
4) Zhi

Ku's son Xie, born miraculously to Jiandi after she swallowed the egg of a black bird, became the predynastic founder of the ruling family of the Shang dynasty. 

Ku's son Houji, born miraculously to Jiang Yuan after she stepped in the footprint of a god, became the predynastic founder of the lineage of the Zhou dynasty.


It also states that Ku "was born with double rows of teeth, and had the wisdom of a sage", and that he "made blind men beat drums, and strike bells and sounding stones, at which phoenixes flapped their wings and gambolled". 

The Annals further record that in the 16th year of his reign, he sent his general Chung to defeat the state of Yukwai. In the 45th year, Ku designated the prince of Tang (his son Yao) as his successor, however upon his death in the 63rd year, his elder son Zhi then took the throne instead, ruling 9 years before being deposed and replaced by Yao.

------------


According to the legend, Yao became the ruler at 20 and died at 119 when he passed his throne to Shun the Great, to whom he gave his two daughters in marriage.

The Bamboo Annals offers a different story. Shun rebelled and imprisoned Yao where he is left to die. Danzhu is exiled and later defeated by Shun.

[rluu: Became a ruler at age 20, and died at 119.]

---------------

According to traditional sources, Shun received the mantle of leadership from Emperor Yao at the age of 53, and then died at the age of 100 years. Before his death Shun is recorded as relinquishing his seat of power to Yu: an event which is supposed to have eventuated in the establishment of the Xia Dynasty. Shun's capital was located in Puban (蒲阪), presently located in Shanxi).

Under Emperor Yao, Shun was appointed successively Minister of Instruction, General Regulator and chief of the Four Peaks, and put all affairs in proper order within three years.




After ascending to the throne, Shun offered sacrifices to God, as well as to the hills, rivers, and the host of spirits.[4] Then he toured the eastern, the southern, the western, and the northern parts of the country; in each place he offered burnt-offering to Heaven at each of the four peaks (Mount Tai, Mount Huang, Mount Hua and Mount Heng), sacrificed to the hills and rivers, set in accord the seasons, months, and days, established uniform measurements of length and capacities, and reinforced ceremonial laws.[5]

Shun divided the land into twelve provinces, raising altars upon twelve hills in each, and deepening the rivers.[6] Shun dealt with four criminals: banishing the Minister of Works to You island, confining Huan-dou on Mount Chong; driving San-Miao into San-Wei, and holding Gun a prisoner till his death on Mount Yu.[7] Yu was subsequently appointed Minister of Works to govern the water and the land.[8] Later, Shun appointed Yu to be General Regulator (Prime Minister).[8] Yu wished to decline in favour of the Minister of Agriculture, or Xie, or Gao Yao, but finally accepted upon Shun's insistence.[8] Shun then appointed Chui as the new Minister of Works.[9] Shun also appointed Yi as Minister of Animal Husbandry to govern the beasts and trees of the land,[10] Bo-yi as Priest of the Ancestral Temple to perform religious ceremonies,[11] Hui as Director of Music,[12] Long as Minister of Communications to counter deceptions and false reports.[13]



When Emperor Yao became old, he distressed over the fact that his 9 sons were all useless, only knew how to spend their days enjoying themselves with wines and songs. Yao asked his administers, the Four Mountains, to propose a suitable successor. Yao then heard of Shun's tales. Wise Yao did not want to simply believe in the tales about Shun, so he decided to test Shun. Yao gave a district to Shun to govern and married his two daughters to him, with a small dowry of a new house and some money. [story continues.]


Shun began to reign at the age of 30, reigned with Yao for 30 years, and reigned 50 years after Yao's death, then Shun died.[14]

Events of Shun's reign

    In the 3rd year of his reign, he ordered Jiutao (咎陶) to establish penalties to deal with various criminals.
    In the 9th year of his reign, the West Queen came to worship in China and brought white jade rings and Jue (玦) as gifts.

    In the 32nd year of his reign, he transferred military power to Yu of Xia.
    In January of the 33rd year of his reign, he rewarded Yu of Xia for his achievement in managing the floods, in the aftermath of which, nine provinces were re-established in China.
    In the 35th year of his reign, he ordered Yu of Xia to send troops to Youmiao (有苗). After Yu achieved victory, Youmiao sent an envoy with a request to join China.
    In his 36th year of his reign, he ordered the Great Wall (of Shun's time, not the current Great Wall of China) to be torn down.
    In the 42nd year of his reign, the Xuandu (玄都) people came to worship him and brought precious jade as gifts.
    The winter of the 47th year of his reign was very warm and the grass did not die.
    In the 49th year of his reign, he moved to Mingtiao (鸣条), a place later called Haizhou (海州) during the Warring States Period. His death came the following year, after a rule described as having lasted fifty years.

Huang Di (Yellow Emperor).
He is also named Xuanyuan (cart/chariot).
(xuan refers to a high-fronted, curtained carriage used in ancient times, and yuan refers to the shafts fo a cart).
(The "Xuanyuan Fang" was a compass cart constructed by Huang Di, and used by him in the war.)

Huang Di lived for 300 years.
Huang Di had 4 faces.

Huang Di was the son of Shaodian.  
Huang Di was the half brother of Yan Di (Emperor of the south).  

Huang Dihad 4 wives:
  - Leizu (she started sericulture, the cultivation of silkworms and silk production.  Huang Di honored her as the Road Goddess.)
  - Momu (unsightly in appearance but of great virtues.  she supervises the other concubines.)
       

He is also the most important of the Five August Emperors (names differ in different texts).  He defeated Yan Di, Chiyou, and other deities.  

In some descriptiosn, he functions as the Thunder God.  

Huang Di is portrayed as a human being with 4 faces.  

About his birth:
His mother, Fubao, saw a great bolt of lightning one night circling one of the stars in the Great Bear.  It was so bright that it lit up the area nearby.  Then Fubao became pregnant, and after 25 months, she gave burth to Huang Di.  

From the text Dadai Liji:
1) When Huang was just born, he was smart.
2) When he was a baby, he could talk.
3) When he was a child, he was quick.
4) When he grew up, he was honest and clever.
5) When he was an elder, he was wise.


Huang Di was 300 years old when he died.

Huang Di often appears as the ruler of the central part of hte world.  

A text from Huainanzi sets Huang Di and the other 4 divine emperors in an orderly pantheon distributed in 5 directions (East, South, West, North, and Center) and 5 elements (wood, fire, metal, water, and earth).  

Direction:      God:       Subordinate:     Description:
----------     -------     -------------    -------------
East (wood):    Taihao.    Goumang.         Both hold the compass and control 
                                            the season of spring.
South (fire):   Yan Di.    Zhuming.         both hold the beams of steelyards 
                                            and control the season of summer.  
Center (earth): Huang Di.  Houtu.           Both hold ropes and control 
                                            the 4 directions.  
West (metal):   Shaohao.   Rushou.          Both hold carpenter's squares and 
                                            control the season of autumn.
North (water);  Zhuanxu.   Xuanming.        Both hold sliding weights of 
                                            steelyards and control the 
                                            season of winter. 

Huang Di was the most powerful ruler of the center and the other 4 directions.  

[rluu: It appears that Huang Di is equated to Levi and the Levites.  
The battle between Huang Di and the other 4 Emperorers appears to map up to the siege of New York in TTTA?  Huang Di went to fortify the walls and commanded the army himself and in the end defeated the four emperors.


Yan Di (Flame Emperor) is the half brother of Huang Di.  Yan Di is said to have controlled hlfo the world while Huang Di controlled the other half.  Huang Di ruled his kingdom based on benevolence and love, but Yan Di did not follow these principles.  They fought at the open plain of Zhuolu.  It was a fierce battle; blood flowed like a stream that could float the pestles.  At last Huang Di killed Yan Di and took his land.  The world then became peaceful.  

According to another text:

When Huang Di fought Yan Di, he ordered these animals:
1) Black bears
2) Grizzly bears
3) Wolves
4) Panthers
5) Cougars
6) Tigers

Huang Di's banners:
1) Eagles
2) Fighting pheasants
3) Falcons
4) Phoenixes

Another myth states that the battle between the two brothers lasted for a long time.  Huang Di fought against his brother many times before finally winning the war.  

---

Battle between Huang Di and Chiyou.
Chiyou is the descendant of Yan Di.  
Chiyou has either many brothers (various versions say: 80, 71, or 81)

Each brother had an animal body, bronze head, and iron forehead, speaking a human language.  They used sand and stone as their food.  Other versions state that Chiyou had a human body, horned head, ox hooves, 4 eyes, 6 hands, and ears and temlpes like swords and spears.  He seems to be a former subordinate of Huang Di, but later he somehow became a rebel.  

Chiyou made weapons and attacked Huang Di, so Huang Di commanded Yinglong to launch an attack against Chiyou in the wilderness of the central plain.  Yinglong began by storing all teh water.  Chiyou asked Feng Bo and Yu Shi to release a cloudburst.  Then Huang Di asked the drought goddess Ba to descend from heaven, and the rain was stopped.  Eventually Huang Di killed Chiyou.  

Many stories describing the course and circumstances of the war.  One story states that Chiyou was able to soar into the sky and surmount the dangerous and difficult obstructions.  But Huang Di made a drum from the hide of Kui, a 1-legged mythical creature, and beat it many times.  The sound it made was so great that it revented Chiyou from flying away, and he was caught and killed by Huang Di.  

Another version states that Chiyou led many ferocious mythical animals to attack Huang Di on the Zhuolu plain.  In response, Huang Di ordered his subjects to blow horns sounding like dragons to threaten them.  

Another version asserts that Chiyou could stir up clouds and mist.  When he fought with Haung Di, he made heavy fog for 3 days.  Huang Di's army was caught in it and could not determine their direction.  Huang Di then invented the compass cart and guided his army out of the fog.  Thus Huang Di defeated Chiyou and killed him.  

[rluu: Compass cart is the "South Pointing Chariot".  see pg. 142 and wikipedia.]

Some versions maintain that after Huang Di fought against HCiyou many times, and still could not win, he retreated with his army to Mount Tai.  There was a thick fog lasting for 3 days.  In the fog, Huang Di saw a lady with a woman's head and a serpent's body.  he kowtowed, bowed twice, flattened himself against the ground and did not dare stand up.  The lady said, "I am Xuan Nu (litterally "Dark Lady")".  Huang Di asks for 'myriad attacks', myriad wins.  So the goddess taught himt eh art of war, and he defeated Chiyou in the end.  

[rluu: Dark Lady is Kali.  See my timeline of Hindu holidays with the Kali connection to 3 days.]

In some accounts, huang Di is said to 'have fought 55 times and then the whole world obeyed him.'

[rluu: 55 fights.]


pg. 142

Huang Di's cultural inventions:
1) Drilled wood for fire and then cooked fresh meat.
2) Hollowed a tree trunk to make a boat and cut branches to make oars.  Therefore peopel could travel by water.
3) He tamed cattle and horses to draw carts so that the peopel could use them to carry heavy goods.
4) Inspiried by teh erigeron that could endlessly rotate in teh wind, he made the wood cart.  And that is why he was also called Xuanyuan ('xuan' refers to a high-fronted, curtained carriage used in ancient times, and yuan refers to the shafts of a cart.).  
5) He cut trees and used them to build a variety of houses to protect people from teh wind and rain.  
6) He invented hats, crowns, and clothes.
7) He cut wood to make pestles and dug earth to make mortar.  
8) He made a caldron to steam rice.  
[...]


After he met the goddess Xiwangmu, he made 12 mirrors and used one in each month.  So it was also Huang Di who invented the mirror.  

He invented coffins for the dead.  After he killed Chiyou, he buried him, and that originated the custom of burial.  

He is said to make the rules for wedding ceremonies.  

****
Among his numerous inventions, the compass cart is famed.  


Explaination of how Huang Di invented the compass cart.  
Huang Di was a chieftain in the central plain.
Yan Di was a chieftain in the east.  
Admiring the better life in teh central plain, Yan Di commanded his clan to attack Huang Di's.  
Thoguh Yan Di failed in the battle, the winner, Huang Di, wanted to ally with him.

They became sworn brothers, and their clans were united into one large country.  Meanwhile, in teh southeast, there was another clan, and its leader was Chiyou.  Chiyou also coveted the prosperity of the central plain, so he ordered his people to invade the central plain.  Huang Di then commanded his army to fight Chiyou.  it was the middle of autumn, and there often was heavy fog.  Having difficulties discerning the direction, Huang Di's army was defeated several times.  Therefore, Huang Di spent much time in discovering a means for telling the directions.  At length he found that a kind of magentite could help.  He then made a carved wooded man with a magnetite hand installed in it.  No matter where he was, the magnetite hand always pointed to the south.  Therefore Huang Di named it Fang ('Direction').  Later Huang Di built a cart and fixed the carved man on it, so it could easily be moved around.  Huang Di called the whole system Xuanyuan Fang.  Sometime later the name was changed to "compass cart".

pg. 143
Taoists say that Huang Di "ascended to heaven" at the end of his secular life.  

From the text Shiji:
Huang Di gathered copper at Mount Shoushan.  He used it to make a big ding (a tripot caldron).  When the ding had been made, a dragon witha long beard descended from heaven to meet him.  Huang Di rode on it, and more than 70 of his officials and concubines followed him.  Since there were too many lower subordinates to ride onteh dragon, they grabbed on to the dragon's beard and were dragged along underneath.  They were so heavy that they pulled the beard out before the dragon could ascend to heaven.  Huang Di's bow also fell.  With Huang Di ascending ot heaven, people on teh ground held his bow and the dragon's beard and cried.  From then on, the place was called Ding Hu (hu means "beard"), and the bow was called Wuhao (meaning "cry").  



Huang Di's birthday is March 3 in the Chinese lunar calendar.

Jiandi
Second wife of Di Ku.

Story of the conception and birth of Qi:

There were once two beautiful girls (one of which was Jiandi).  They lived in a terrace 9 stories high.  Each meal they ate had to be accompanied by drum music.  One day the Supreme Divinity (Di) sent a swallow to visit them.  The swallow sweetly sang, repeating "Yiyi".  The two girls loved it so much that they tried to catch the swallow.  Finally they covered it with a jade basket.  When they lifted up teh basket after a while, the swallow flew away immediately toward the North, leaving two eggs behind.  The girls were so diappointed that they composed a song, singing "Swallow, swallow, you flew away", which is credited with being the origin of the northern music.  [rluu: Musical vibration starts?].    Another commentator wrote that the Supreme Divinity was in fact the God of Heaven, it was he who ordered the swallow to lay two eggs for the girls to swallow so that one would give birth to Qi.  

[rluu: Numbers 9, a swallow, and 2 eggs.  One of the eggs spawn Qi.]


Another version:

One day Jiandi and her sisters went out to take a bath in the river of Xuanqui when they saw a swallow passing by and dropping a colorful egg.  They all competed with each other to catch it, and Jiandi won.  Protecting it from being seized by her sisters, she put the egg into her mouth, but swallowed it by accident.  Then she became pregnant and later gave birth to Qi.  

[rluu: Colorful egg.]

From wikipedia article:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_Sovereigns_and_Five_Emperors

There is also the legend of the Four shi (四氏) who took part in creating the world. The four members are Youchao-shi (有巢氏), Suiren-shi (燧人氏), Fu Xi-shi (伏羲氏), and Shennong-shi (神農氏).[5]


Numbers: 
115 + 110 + 500 = 725 = 25 * 29
or 
115 + 110 + 500 + 39 = 764 = 191 * 4

Shennong-shi lived 197 years.


------

Youchao (Chinese: 有巢, pinyin: Yǒucháo), is the inventor of house and building, according to China's ancient mythology. It is said he is one of The Three August Ones in remote ancient China.[citation needed]
He was also the second ruler of China, who ruled for 110,000 years.



Suiren (Chinese: 燧人, pinyin: suì rén), is the discoverer of fire, according to Chinese mythology. He is one of the legendary Three August Ones from ancient Chinese history. Images of Suiren depict him as having three eyes. He is said to have reigned half a million years during the Pleistocene epoch.

[rluu: 500,000 years?]


In Chinese mythology, Fu Xi (Fuxi) or Fu Hsi (Fu-hsi) (Chinese: 伏羲; pinyin: Fúxī; Wade–Giles: Fu2-hsi1), also known as Paoxi or Pao-hsi (simplified Chinese: 庖牺; traditional Chinese: 庖犧; pinyin: Páoxī; Wade–Giles: Pao2-hsi1), reigned during the mid-29th century BCE, was the first of the Three Sovereigns (三皇 Sānhuáng) of ancient China. He is a culture hero reputed to be the inventor of writing, fishing, and trapping. However, Cangjie is also said to have invented writing.


According to legend, the land was swept by a great flood and only Fu Xi and his sister Nüwa survived. They retired to the mythological Kunlun Mountain, where they prayed for a sign from the Emperor of Heaven. The divine being approved their union and the siblings set about procreating the human race. In order to speed up the process, Fu Xi and Nüwa used clay to create human figures, and with the power divine entrusted to them made the clay figures come alive.[1] Fu Xi then came to rule over his descendants, although reports of his long reign vary between sources, from 115 years (2852–2737 BCE) to 116 years (2952–2836 BCE).

Fu Xi is said to have lived for 197 years altogether and died at a place called Chen (modern Huaiyang, Henan), where a monument to him can still be found and visited as a tourist attraction.[1]

[rluu: Reign of either 115 or 116.  Lifespan was 197.]


Shennong (Shen-nung; simplified Chinese: 神农; traditional Chinese: 神農; pinyin: Shénnóng; Wade–Giles: Shen2-nung2; Japanese: Shinno, 神農; Korean: 신농, Sinnong; Vietnamese: Thần Nông), whose name literally means "Divine Farmer" and who is also known as the Emperor of the Five Grains (t 五穀先帝, s 五谷先帝, p Wǔgǔxiāndì), was a legendary ruler of China and culture hero. Shennong is considered to have been one of the Three Sovereigns (also known as "Three Emperors") who lived some 5,000 years ago.

In Chinese mythology Shennong, besides having taught humans the use of the plow together with other aspects of basic agriculture, the use of medicinal plants, and having been a god of the burning wind (perhaps in some relationship to the Yan Emperor mythos and/or slash-and-burn agriculture,[3] in which the ash produced by fire fertilizes the fields), was sometimes said to be a progenitor to, or to have had appointed as one of his ministers, Chi You; and like him, they were both ox-headed, sharp-horned, bronze-foreheaded, and iron-skulled.[4] One difference between mythology and science is exemplified in Chinese mythology: Shennong and Huangdi (often known as "the Yellow Emperor") were supposedly friends and fellow scholars, despite the 500 years or seventeen or eighteen generations between the first Shennong and Huangdi; and, that together they shared the alchemical secrets of medicine, immortality, and making gold.

The sacrifice of cows or oxen to Shennong in his various manifestations is never at all appropriate, instead pigs and sheep are acceptable. Fireworks and incense may also be used, especially at the appearance of his statue on his birthday, lunar April 26, according to popular tradition. 

c. 2737 BC – c. 2698 BC
[rluu: This interval is 39 years.]

Jiang Yuan

The first consort of Di Ku, and the mother of Houji.  

Jiang yuan stepped into a huge footprint in a field and miraculously gave birth to Houji, the God of Agriculture and founder of the Zhou people.  

Poem from "Shijing" text:

The first birth of our people was from Jiang Yuan.  How did she give birth to a person?  She had offered a sacrifice to the Supreme Divinity, to ward off the misfortune of childlessness.  By chance, she stepped into a huge toe-print made by the Supreme Divinity, and her body was stirred.  She then began to live in a separate room undistrubed.  Jiang Yuan became pregnant, and she behaved even more devoutly and solemnly.  She gave birth to a son who was Houji.  When her birth had come to full-term, she delivered as easy as the birth of a lamb.  Then she abandoned her son on a narrow lane, but the sheep and oxen protected him and fed him.  She tried to place him in a forest, but gave up there because there happened to be many wood-cutters there.  She then threw him away on cold ice, and a bird sheltered and supported him with its wings.  When the bird flew away, Houji began to wail.  His cry was so long and loud, that his voice filled all his surroundings [...] [pg. 150-151]

[rluu: I think Houji is connected to Tammuz (Hebrew) and Dumuzi (Sumerian).
    Dumuzid of Bad-tibira, the shepherd (reigning 36 000 years), the fifth King before the Flood.
    Dumuzid of Kuara, the fisherman (reigning 100 years), the third King of the first dynasty of Uruk, reigning between Lugalbanda and Gilgamesh.
]


Another legend says that when Jiang was still a young girl, one snowy day in winter she went to the threshing ground to fetch some firewood.  The snow was so heavy that she could hardly walk.  Then she found 2 lines of huge footprints along the road where she should go, and she stepped in them.  Because the footprints were made by a god, she got pregnant by stepping in them.  When she was ready to give birth and was going to be brought to bed in her home, her mother made her ride a mule and go tot he field to give birth since she felt shamed by her daughter's pregnancy.  When the baby was ready to appear, the mule also happened to be ready to give birth.  Worried that this might distrub her own childbirth, Goddess Jiang used a gold needle to block the mule's birth canal.  From then on the mule could no longer bear offspring.  When the baby came out, she threw it into a pool.  It was in June, but the pool water suddenly iced up.  While the baby lay on the ice, birds flew over to cover and warm him.  Since that time, the pool would ice up every June.  Meanwhile, Jiang's sister-in-law sent a pot of dough drop soup to the field, but the pot was broken halfway there, and teh soup flowed down a local hillside, so it later was called "the Hillside of Dough Drop Soup."  Believing that Jiang's miraculous conception woudl bring misfortune to the village, some of her neighbors chased after her and tried to beat her.  Goddess Jiang ran away.  When they had almost caught her, there suddenly came a gale that blew for three days.  When the gale stopped, the people found that Goddess Jiang had disappeared and that a mausoleum appeared in her place.  They called the building "Jiang Yuan's Mausoleum".  

A mausoleum is an external free-standing building constructed as a monument enclosing the interment space or burial chamber of a deceased person or people.

Jingwei

Jingwei is a mythical bird that metamorphosed from yan Di's daughter and indomitably tried to fill up the sea with pebbles.

Yan Di, the Flame Emperor, had a young daughter named Nu Wa (different from teh great mother and cosmic repairer Nuwa; nu means "female", wa means "child").  Nu Wa was playing in the eastern sea, but was fatally drowned and never returned.  She turned into a bird called Jingwei.  Jingwei lived on Fajiu Mountain, located in the north.  It looked like crow but had a colorful head, white beak, and red clars.  Its name is derived from the sound of its call, which sounds like "jingwei".  It always carried a pebble or a twig in its mouth, and dropped it into the eastern sea, where Nu Wa lost her young life.  Jingwei tried unyieldingly to fill up the vast sea with its tiny efforts, never stopping.  

In one version, Jingwei was said to have mated with a sea swallow.  Their female children looked much like Jingwei, and the male children looked mcuh like the sea swallow.  Because Jingwei was drowned in teh eastern sea in its preexistence, it swore not to drink the water of the eastern sea.  Thus it was also called Oath Bird.  And since it had not yet received revenge for its grudge and resentment, Jingwei was also called the Grudge Bird.  Sometimes it is called the Resolve Bird.

Kuafu

Kuafu is the grandson of Houtu.
Kuafu was the mythical hero who chased the sun to compete with it in a race but died of thirst in the end.  His walking stick then transformed into a forest of peach trees.


pg. 156

There was a mountain called Chengdu Zaitian in the great wilderness.  A god named Kuafu lived in it.  There were 2 yellow snakes circling his ears and another 2 yellow snakes in his hands.  He was the grandson of Houtu.  Kuafu overvalued his own strength, so he wanted to chase the sun's shadow and catch the sun at Yugu (Yu Valley).  He felt very thirsty halfway there, so he decided to drink from teh river.  Since the river water was not enough for him, he then decided to go to the great marsh. But he died of thirst on his way.  

Another text from teh same book states that Kuafu competed with teh sun in a race.  He entere dinto the aureole of the sun.  Being very thirsty, he went to drink in the Yellow River and the Wei River, but they were not enough for him.  Then he decided to go northward to the great marsh.  He died of thirst before he arrived there.  His walking stick transformed into a forest of peach trees.  Another version appearing in Liezi [text] adds that after Kuafu died of thirst in his race witht eh sun, he abandoned his walking stick.  Hourished by teh fat from his corpse, the stick turned into a peach tree forest, whcih extended for thousands of miles.  

Kuafu was a man who lived at the shore of the east sea.  He was good at walking and running very fast.  he was familiar with teh sunrise, but wondered how it set, so he took a stick and chased the sun.  When he ran to this mountain (Mount Kuafu), he was so thirsty that he died there.  

Another modern myth says that Kuafu died of anger rather than thirst.  He knew how the sun rose, but wanted to know how the Sun set, so he chased after the sun to have a look.  During the chase, he ran to this mount (Mount Kuafu) and he was thirsty, drank some water and took a nap.  When he awoke, he saw that the sun was just about to set.  Realizing that he could not catch up with the sun, he was extremely angry and at last died of anger. 

[rluu:  Is this saying that when a planet goes retrograde, the cycle death comes?  So is retrograde equal to anger?  Maybe not, because the celebration is a specific time of the year.]

In every lunar October (some versions say February), villagers in Kuafu Valley would offer sacrifices and perform local operats for him.  The fair usually lasted for 3 to 5 days.

Kui is the one-legged mythical monster kileld by Huang Di.  His hide was used to make a drum for Huang Di to defeat Chiyou.  

Kui lived on Mount Liubo (literally "flowing wave") in the east sea.  It looked like an ox but was gray, hornless, and one-legged.  Whenever it came out or dived into the sea, a storm would follow.  Its light was like the sunlight and moonlight, and its sound was like the thunder.  

Later it was caught by Huang Di, who made a drum by using its hide as the cover.  When struck with the bone of the Thunder God, the drum made a great sound that could be heard over 500 miles away.  Huang Di used the drum to show his power ot the whole world.  In some versions, this drum made by Kui's skin played an important role in the battle between Huang Di and Chiyou.  

Other versions depict Kui as a 1-legged horned dragon.  Its scales shone like the sun and moon.  If it happened to be seen, it would bring a drought to the place where it was seen.  Sometimes Kui was said to look like a monkey with a man's face and had the abilityt o talk.  Kui was also described as a drum-shaped animal with one leg.  It was the spirit of the mountain.  If one called its name, then it could help one to catch the tiger and panther.
