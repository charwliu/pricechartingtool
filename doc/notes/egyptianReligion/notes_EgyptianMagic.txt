Notes on the book "Egyptian Magic" by sir Wallis Budge.


rluu_20130524: Notes were not taken in an orderly way.  I skimmed the book and just took notes where I felt information might be more important.  Maybe it is worth coming back and reading this book more carefully?

pg. 163

When th deceased comes ot the Hall of Judgement, at teh very beginning of his speech, he says, 'Homage to thee, O Great God, thou Lord of Maati, I have come to thee, O my Lord, and I have brought myself hither that I may behold thy beauties.  I know thee, and I know thy name, and I know the names of the two and forty gods who exist with thee in this Hall of Maati."

[Footnote for this quote says to see "Chapters of Coming Forth by Day", pg. 191]

[rluu: 42 gods!]

But although the gods may be favorable to him, and he be found righteous in teh judgement, he cannot make his way among the other gods of the underworld without a knowledge fo the names of certain parts of the Hall of Maati.  After the judgement he acquires the mystical name of "He who is equipped with the flowers and the dweller in his olive tree," and it is only after he has utter this name that the gods say "Pass onwards."  

Next the gods invite him to enter the Hall of Maati, but he is not allowed to pass in until he has, in answer to questions asked by the bolts, lintels, threshold, fastenings, socket, door-leaves, and door-posts, told their names.  The floor of the Hall will not permit him to walk upon it unless he tells not only its name, but also the mystical names of his two legs and feet wherewith he is about to tread upon it.  

pg. 164

When all this has been done the guardian of the Hall says to him, "I will not announce thy name [to the god] unless thou tellest me my name"; and the deceased replies "'Discerner of hearts and searcher of the reins' is thy name."  In reply to this the guardian says, "If i announce thy name thou must utter the name of the god who dwelleth in his hour," and the deceased utters the name "Maau-Taui".  But still the guardian is not satisfied, and he says, "If I announce thy name thou must tell me who is he whose heaven is of fire, whose walls [are surmounted by] living uraei, and the floor of whose house is a stream of water.  Who si he, I say?  (i.e., what is his name?)"

The decased has, of course, learnt the name of the Great God, and he replies, "Osiris".

The gaurdian of the Hall is now content, and he says,
"Advance, verily thy name shall be mentioned to him".; and he further promises that the cakes, and ale, and sepulcharal meals which the deceased shall enjoy shall come from the "Eye of Ra".


In another Chapter [See "Chapters of Coming Forth by Day" pg. 128], the deceased addresses the seven gods, and says "Hail ye seven being who make decrees, who support the Balance on the night of the judgement of the Utchat, who cut off heads, who hack necks in pieces, who take possessions of hearts by violence and rend the places where hearts are fixed, who make slaughterings in the Lake of Fire, I know you, and I know your names; therefore know ye me, even as I knwo your names."  The deceased, having declared that the seven gods know his name and he their names, has no further apprehension that evil will befall him.  

pg. 165

In one portion of the kingdom of Osiris, there existed seven halls, or mansions through which the deceased was anxious to pass, but each of the gates was guarded by a doorkeeper, a watcher, and a herald, and it required special provision on teh part of the deceased to satisfy these being that he had a right to pass them.  In teh first place, figures of the seven gates had to be made in some substance (or painted upon papyrus), as well as a figure of the deceased: the latter was made to approach each of the gates and to stand before it and to recite an address whcih had been specially prepared ofr the purpose.  Meanwhile the thigh, teh head, the heart, and the hoof of a red bull were offered at each gate, as well as a very large number of miscellaneous offerings which need not be described in detail.  But all these ceremonies would not help the deceased to pass through the gates, unless he knew the names of the seven doorkeepers, and the seven watchers, and the seven herals who guarded them.  

[rluu: 7 + 7 + 7 = 21]

pg. 165-166

The gods of the first gate, second, etc. are:
1) Sekhet-hra-asht-aru, Semetu, and Hukheru
2) Tun-hat, Seqet-hra, and Sabes
3) Am-huat-ent-pehfi, Res-hra, and Uaau
4) Khesef-hra-asht-kheru, Res-ab, and Neteka-hra-khesef-atu
5) Ankh-em-fentu, Ashebu, Tebherkehaat
6) Akentauk-ha-kheru, An-hra, and Metes-hra-ari-she
7) Metes-sen, Aaa-kheru, and Khesef-hra-khemiu.


pg. 166

And the text, which the deceased recites to the Halls collectively, begins, "Hail ye Halls! Hail, ye who made the Halls for Osiris!  Hail, ye who watch your Halls!  hail ye who herald the affirs of the two lands for the god Osiris each day, the deceased knoweth you, and he knoweth your names."

[Footnote to see "Chapters of Coming Forth by Day" pg. 241]

The names having been uttered, and the addresses duly recited, the deceased went wherever he pleased in the seven Halls of Osiris.  


But beside the seven halls of the deceased had ot pass through the twenty-one hidden pylons of the house of Osiris in the Elysian Fields, and in order to do so he had to declare the names of the pylon and the door-keeper of each, and to make a short address besides.  

[rluu: 21 hidden pylons.]
