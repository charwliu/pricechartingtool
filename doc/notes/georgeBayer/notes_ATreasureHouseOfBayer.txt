Notes on the book "A Treasure House Of Bayer" by George Bayer.

rluu_20130809:  I'm not sure if the page numbers in this book are the same ones as in the original printing.  It looks as if it was re-typed or OCRed at some point.

pg. 15

For a geocentric pair of planets:

First  conjunction is the "Least Conjunction".
Second conjunction is the "Mean Conjunction".
Third  conjunction is the "Greater Conjunction".


Least conjunction: Shake hands.

Mean conjunction: One pats the other on the shoulder.  

Greater conjunction: Shake hands again, but carry along the thoughts exchanged during htis meeting.  



The third or great conjunction is the one of most importance.  This is the one used to calculate specific events in sotck market movements as well as in natal analysis.  


pg. 16

Bayer gives the location of the 3 geocentric conjunctions of Saturn/Uranus and the position of the Sun during these moments.  

[rluu: Perhaps we should check the locations of other planets during this moment also, or what happens in transit after these conjunctions.]


Numbers/time periods given in Bayer's text:

"BOOKS" (word is in all caps)

"As long as 6 months, sometimes even a year."

[rluu: Is it 6 months or a year, or is it 6 months to a year?]

"2 years in advance"


pg. 18

[4 bullets points given.]

pg. 18-19

"Reflex positions" (mirrored positions) that are echo positions.  These respond exactly as if actually a planet was located at that spot.  Any planet, in its progressed movement, striking such a spot by some angle will cause an event to occur that is of the nature of the actual planet whose reflex or mirror causes that specific to irritated.  

Instead of 13 positions in a birth chart, we find the number increased 3-fold, and we have 39 additional spots that are fixed positions of planets at birth.  


pg. 19

[3 bullet points given.]
Bullet #3:
Degree of the Moon's position + trine.

pg. 26

Each commodity has its own cycles that had its beginning at dates different from the dates of hte stocks based upon it.  

Make it a rule to trade in stocks that actually move with the trend and leave alone those that temporarily move against it. 

Trade only in active stocks which have plenty of volume.  

pg. 30

Business activity follows sunspot activity.

pg. 36-38

Flier of the "3 days and 3 nights" astrology conference.

[... more numbers...]

"Not a moment of the entire 3-day convention was wasted, each day being crowed with worth-while discussions from early morning until virtually midnight."


pg. 49-52

Astrology article by Dr. W. M. Davidson.

pg. 53

Article "I Beg Your Pardon" by Bayer, referring to Dr. W. M. Davidson's article.  Bayer says the article gives many correct and good things.  The things that are not correct, Bayer is rectifying in this present article.


About planet rulerships:
Which rules which?  

The Bible from the beginning to the end tells you that there is not one ruler for one single thing, be it a man, an animal, a stock, etc., but there are always TWO rulers.  The rulers of the various things are so easily detected when the law is known that an error is hardly possible.  Just read it out of hte Bible.  We consult Deut. 28 and 29, where it tells you each one separately.  Lev. 11:3, Lev. 11:13, etc. contain other lists of things being ruled.  Of course, it all is a matter of starting right and the string will run off just as if one unwinds a spool of thread.  If one grasps once the idea that hte Bible is loaded full with rules and laws and it is all there for the one who wants to take them and use them, then the biggest obstacle for astrologers is removed.  

pg. 54

Bayer says his work is solely confined to the use of Astrology in market movements and in the interpretation of the Bible.  

Mercury whose home, according to the Bible is in Capricorn, and not in Virgo or Gemini as the books try to tell, and who is represented in the Bible by Rebecca, the wife of Jacob, ends its cycle each year at 30 degrees Pisces in most cases.  A cycle as I understand fromt eh Bible is not comprising an up and down movement, but a movement that begins slowly, accelerates, and keeps on accelerating until it ends; suddenly at the end no more, death.  We know that the faster a planet moves, the better it is.  It carries within itself a lot of pepe.  Mercury, the planet of intelligence, versatility and thought, has its greatest cycle speed in Pisces and a native whose Mercury is in Pisces hould grasp languages, i.e., retain thousands of words without difficulty -- if -- it happens to be in the Rebecca cycle.  but it is possible that his birth is not in the Rebecca cycle, that is that she does not die that year, this person will do just the opposite; he will not be able to learn rapdily at all, and to study languages is out of hte question.  

The comparison may be had looking over the movements of stocks, of wheat, and other commodities, and we shall find that March, at the time Mercury is nearly always in Pisces, the movement are very swift and important bottoms and tops are made at that time.  We make more tops and bottoms in March than in any other month of the year.  This is due to Mercury, ending its cycle either as a bottom or a top.  Much more could be said in this respect, but a lot of underlying biblical laws would have to be generaly understood first before it could be undestood.  

pg. 65-67

Article "Notes to Traders for April, 1937" by George Bayer.
Article is about market patterns that look like zodiac signs.  

Virgo.  Scorpio.

Bayer gives dates that matches the pattern he is describing.  

Stocks is working out the Scorpio.

pg. 66:
Bayer says: Genesis 14:3,10 states clearly that sign of Virgo represents stones, hills and mountains, as well as teh Salt sea.  


pg. 69

Sting of Scoprio will be reached this month (May 1937).

Bayer talks about the location when the planet is closest to the Sun is the when it is moving the fastest.  

Movement speed of the markets corresponds to these planetary speeds.
