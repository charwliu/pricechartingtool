Notes on the book "A Treasure House Of Bayer" by George Bayer.

rluu_20130809:  I'm not sure if the page numbers in this book are the same ones as in the original printing.  It looks as if it was re-typed or OCRed at some point.

pg. 15

For a geocentric pair of planets:

First  conjunction is the "Least Conjunction".
Second conjunction is the "Mean Conjunction".
Third  conjunction is the "Greater Conjunction".


Least conjunction: Shake hands.

Mean conjunction: One pats the other on the shoulder.  

Greater conjunction: Shake hands again, but carry along the thoughts exchanged during htis meeting.  



The third or great conjunction is the one of most importance.  This is the one used to calculate specific events in sotck market movements as well as in natal analysis.  


pg. 16

Bayer gives the location of the 3 geocentric conjunctions of Saturn/Uranus and the position of the Sun during these moments.  

[rluu: Perhaps we should check the locations of other planets during this moment also, or what happens in transit after these conjunctions.]


Numbers/time periods given in Bayer's text:

"BOOKS" (word is in all caps)

"As long as 6 months, sometimes even a year."

[rluu: Is it 6 months or a year, or is it 6 months to a year?]

"50 or 60 Latin texts, from cover to cover."

"past 200 years"

[6 items listed.]

"some 800 various books on astrology"


pg. 17
"ONE day"  (word is in all caps)

"After 2 months of study, it was found that both were right.  A case of incomplete knowledge."

"2 years in advance"


pg. 18

[4 bullets points given.]

pg. 18-19

"Reflex positions" (mirrored positions) that are echo positions.  These respond exactly as if actually a planet was located at that spot.  Any planet, in its progressed movement, striking such a spot by some angle will cause an event to occur that is of the nature of the actual planet whose reflex or mirror causes that specific to irritated.  

Instead of 13 positions in a birth chart, we find the number increased 3-fold, and we have 39 additional spots that are fixed positions of planets at birth.  


pg. 19

[3 bullet points given.]
Bullet #3:
Degree of the Moon's position + trine.
Degree of the Moon's position - trine.

[rluu: Bayer says something of value is hidden here.]



Major swings: 3 to 6 months
Bull and bear markets: 6 or 8 years.

Cycles within cycles.


Stocks feel good, and move upward.
Stocks feel bad, and move downward.


pg. 20

Bayer refers to his book with all his findings of stock movements:
"The Time Element in the Stock Market", covering some 250 pages.

[rluu: Complete taking notes on this section of the book up to page 23 for stock HR.]


pg. 26

Each commodity has its own cycles that had its beginning at dates different from the dates of hte stocks based upon it.  

Make it a rule to trade in stocks that actually move with the trend and leave alone those that temporarily move against it. 

Trade only in active stocks which have plenty of volume.  

pg. 30

Business activity follows sunspot activity.

pg. 36-38

Flier of the "3 days and 3 nights" astrology conference.
Conference is called: "Three Days and Nights of Concentrated, Enthusiastic Professional Good Fellowship".

"burden" word used.

500 to 1000 at each session.
Sept. 1, 2, 3.
Actual attendance figures: nearly 5000 attended one or more of the sessions, and that some 400 attended every session without fail.  

[... more numbers...]

"Not a moment of the entire 3-day convention was wasted, each day being crowed with worth-while discussions from early morning until virtually midnight."


pg. 49-52

Astrology article by Dr. W. M. Davidson.

pg. 53

Article "I Beg Your Pardon" by Bayer, referring to Dr. W. M. Davidson's article.  Bayer says the article gives many correct and good things.  The things that are not correct, Bayer is rectifying in this present article.


About planet rulerships:
Which rules which?  

The Bible from the beginning to the end tells you that there is not one ruler for one single thing, be it a man, an animal, a stock, etc., but there are always TWO rulers.  The rulers of the various things are so easily detected when the law is known that an error is hardly possible.  Just read it out of hte Bible.  We consult Deut. 28 and 29, where it tells you each one separately.  Lev. 11:3, Lev. 11:13, etc. contain other lists of things being ruled.  Of course, it all is a matter of starting right and the string will run off just as if one unwinds a spool of thread.  If one grasps once the idea that hte Bible is loaded full with rules and laws and it is all there for the one who wants to take them and use them, then the biggest obstacle for astrologers is removed.  

pg. 54

Bayer says his work is solely confined to the use of Astrology in market movements and in the interpretation of the Bible.  

Mercury whose home, according to the Bible is in Capricorn, and not in Virgo or Gemini as the books try to tell, and who is represented in the Bible by Rebecca, the wife of Jacob, ends its cycle each year at 30 degrees Pisces in most cases.  A cycle as I understand fromt eh Bible is not comprising an up and down movement, but a movement that begins slowly, accelerates, and keeps on accelerating until it ends; suddenly at the end no more, death.  We know that the faster a planet moves, the better it is.  It carries within itself a lot of pepe.  Mercury, the planet of intelligence, versatility and thought, has its greatest cycle speed in Pisces and a native whose Mercury is in Pisces hould grasp languages, i.e., retain thousands of words without difficulty -- if -- it happens to be in the Rebecca cycle.  but it is possible that his birth is not in the Rebecca cycle, that is that she does not die that year, this person will do just the opposite; he will not be able to learn rapdily at all, and to study languages is out of hte question.  

The comparison may be had looking over the movements of stocks, of wheat, and other commodities, and we shall find that March, at the time Mercury is nearly always in Pisces, the movement are very swift and important bottoms and tops are made at that time.  We make more tops and bottoms in March than in any other month of the year.  This is due to Mercury, ending its cycle either as a bottom or a top.  Much more could be said in this respect, but a lot of underlying biblical laws would have to be generaly understood first before it could be undestood.  

pg. 65-67

Article "Notes to Traders for April, 1937" by George Bayer.
Article is about market patterns that look like zodiac signs.  

Virgo.  Scorpio.

Bayer gives dates that matches the pattern he is describing.  

Stocks is working out the Scorpio.

pg. 66:
Bayer says: Genesis 14:3,10 states clearly that sign of Virgo represents stones, hills and mountains, as well as teh Salt sea.  


pg. 69

Sting of Scoprio will be reached this month (May 1937).

pg. 70

Bayer talks about the location when the planet is closest to the Sun is the when it is moving the fastest.  

Movement speed of the markets corresponds to these planetary speeds (heliocentric aphelion/perhelion).

During the market decline, the move will accelerate (like a waterfall).

pg. 71

The astronomical law says that the faster moves occur near tops and near bottom.


pg. 74

For this year [in the June 1937 issue], sideways down movement until the Sun gets into Cancer, then a trend change is expected that should bring a sharp reversal upwards, running well into July.



Bayer says: "He who has acquired my book 'Time Factors' should add these values to the chapter wherein I treat commodities."  

[rluu: What values?  There is a time diagram with pivot dates for stocks.  Does he mean those values?]


pg. 78-79

Tips for buying puts and calls:

- Always take puts and calls in leading stocks only.  
- Use high-priced stocks for puts as well as for calls.
- The only profitable market moves for puts and calls are:
    1) The sting of a Scorpio formation (acceleration spike upwards top).
    2) "Aries" movement.  (inverted sign of Aries).
    3) Sagittarius movement.  (trending prolonged slide or climb).

pg. 81

Around July 10 [1937], lot of people will start to have "hopes" again for much higher prices and they most likely will buy just at the top once more.  


pg. 83

All we try to get is the trend of things, the trend of Nature as expressed in stock or wheat prices.


Bayer says it is Mars that causes sunspots.


The trick behind it is that during certain definite rounds, Mars just simply does not act, i.e. it runs in neutral.  This queer fact should interest all astrologers when they look for certain aspects to come off and they just won't come.  Reason: the aspect is present, but neutralized, and won't act.  [pg. 83]

Sometimes it happens that the aspects run in neutral and nothing happens, even the contrary might happen!  [pg. 85]



Nature always runs in balance.  Too much on one side is equalized with temporarily too little on the other side.  The whole is present just the same.  


Most people can only think one way, the bull way.  When the bear way arrives, they are not following it to their sorrow later on.  

[rluu: So sorrow is connected to bear market phase?]


When we consider "money and its movements" as something alive, we feel quite sure that it has its ups adn downs like a human being, going into one's pocket and out again and nothing can be done about it.  Money is just as well a part of Nature as anythign else.  


pg. 83

Mars causes the sunspots.  There are certain books available [rluu: the Bible] which show clearly that Mars is the culprit of everything, and that the Sun astrologically should be considered as having, only a very minor role in the life of the Universe, upon human beings, stocks, wheat or anything else.  


pg. 84

Mars influences the movement of wheat and that all we have to know is the cycle in which it repeats its effects.


Nature does not distinguish between weekdays, holidays, or Sundays.  it only recognizes the 7th day, which by the way is not meant as a day of our usual calendar such as is adopted all over the world.  A day as explained in the Bible (if you can read it) is a certain number of degrees, minutes, and seconds int eh Zodiac and not a thing which ahs 24 hours, and no minutes, no seconds.  


[rluu: Bayer says that for this year, Thanksgiving was a day of thanksgiving for the bulls this year.  Is he saying that in more than that sense?  Such that thanksgiving happens at the top of the market when one is able to sell after buying low? ]

pg. 86-88

[Article written in code about the cycles.]

pg. 90-92

[Story about the beginning of the stock market, but the story is really about cycles, written in code. ]

pg. 92

A particular aspect can mean many things to the stock market.  

The repetition of cycles occur in absolutely different ways.  For those who try to figure markets with Astrology, be it said:
- ephemeral aspects
- mutual or lunar aspects
- perihelium or aphelium distances
- Moon on the equator
- Apogee or Perigee of the moon.
- planets in teh Node
- greatest elongation superior or inferior conjunctions

or any such things have nothing to do with stock movements, except that they seem to "click" once in a while.  

[rluu: Is he saying these work and are important, or are they not important?]

pg. 94

Bayer refers to cycle formation details from the Tombs of the old Emperors of Egypt.  These old tombs contain beautiful pictures representing men in all sorts of positions.  Now, these pictures merely represent movements in teh Universe, and in our case movements of the stock market.  


Stocks during March 1938 is a female figure and, "believe it or not", this female is carrying a child too.  The question later on will be: is it one child that will be born later or they even twins?  Bayer says it will be twins that shall be born later on.  

Stocks:
Hands formed: down in January [1938].
Head formed: Last few days of February [1938]
Feet: Later on.  More of that in the next issue.

Wheat:
Hands formed: in January [1938].
Head: Hidden in early February [1938].
"Rear end": Forming the first week of March [1938]. Sharp ups adn downs are due the first week of March, probably over till March 14th.  

Legs of the person stands on the feet, looks backwards towards what has passed 9never forward!).  So you know what we have to expect of wheat the rest of March and even further.  

The formation of the legs in the chart picture are those vicious declines that "murder" all the longs.  Some time in April it will be all over.  The whole decline may be a 20 cent drop or even more.  


All this wisdom is taken from Egyptian astrology, something quite different than Bible astrology.


pg. 95-97

[Letter from a reader in the 'West', who subscribes to Bayer's newsletters.]]
[Letter is dated December 3, 1937.]

[This letter is written in code.]

pg. 98-100

[Letter response from Bayer.]

It took the Lord 6 days to form the earth and heaven.  Even he was unable to do it in a day.  [Bayer makes a reference to the Moon here.]

[This letter is written in code also.]

pg. 100

Stock market is the patient, and we attempt to be the doctor.  

Stocks:
Our patient does not talk or or explain to us what ails him if anything does ail him.  In fact he has rosy cheeks, jumps around like a deer rollicking, when he is just ont eh verage of deadly illness (compare the big movements between March 1 and March 20, 1937 and again between mid-July and mid-August).

When on the other hand, he is nearly dead, when he has completely collapsed, then he suddenly becomes healthy again, when newspapers and others cannot see any thing but further misery.  

He rises liek the dead of the Bible; simply walk away as if never anything had been wrong.  This occurred around Thanksgiving 1937.

In our work we are not only trying to define the health conditions of the patient "market", but even all his other feelings such as happiness, which are also expressed in market movements by so-called "gaps".  

[rluu: So "happiness" is a price gap, upwards?  So would sorrow be a price gap down?]

pg. 101

[rluu: Continue reading and taking notes starting from here.]
