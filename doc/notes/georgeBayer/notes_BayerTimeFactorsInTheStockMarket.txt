Notes on George Bayer's "Time Factors In The Stock Market"

Notes taken February 22, 2013.

rluu_20130222: Note: I know I took notes on this book earlier in time.  I wanted to revisit it and see if I would see more, and perhaps check out the Bible sections referenced in this book.  Below are the notes from this effort started again.  I'm starting to see why I got frustrated before.  I got to a certain point reading this book again (see end of this document), and decided not to continue, for now.  I may return later and try again.

Part 1

pg. 1

Preface of the book is dated: 
January 2, 1937

pg. 4

Important law: Equal causes produce equal events

pg. 7

There is a way to solve the "puzzle of time".  Bayer is sure he has solved it through the careful study of the Bible.

It is a difficult puzzle to solve because:
  - Our system of education
  - Systems of existing philosophies
Neither of these attempts to grasp the main factors.

pg. 8

Theism considers God to be extramudane, as being outside the rules of the world.
Pantheism considers God and Nature to be one and the same.

pg. 8-9

The following laws can only be fully understood when using a pantheistic world conception:

1) The Universe is infinite, unlimited.  It is completely filled with substance throughout.
2) Time of the Universe is infinite, unlimited.  Time has no beginning and no end.
3) Its substance is everywhere, at all times in uninterrupted motion and uninterrupted change.  The infinite quantity of matter remains as fixed as the eternal changing energy.  
4) The universal motion or substance in the Universe is an eternal circular motion with periodically repeating eras.
5) These eras consist of periodic changes of the aggregate condition whereby a primary separation of matter and ether occurs, the ergonomy of ponderable and imponderable matter.
6) This separation has its cause in teh progressively denifying process of matter, in teh formation of uncountable small density centers.  
7) In one part of the Universe, heavenly bodies are formed through the pycnotic process, first small, then larger and the ether between them obtains a greater tension; in other parts of the Universe, the exact opposite process occurs, namely the destruction of heavenly bodies through collisions.  
8) The immense quantities of heat released by these mechanical collisions which effect the motion of the forming cosmic dust masses and the reformation of rotating balls.  So the eternal process repeats indefinitely.  

pg. 12

"primitive centre" or "Source of Attraction".

Whatever particular movements the secondary bodies in universal space may have assumed from teh development of forces of internal forces peculiar to themselves, are subordinated to the great central source of movement, and the forces by which they occur are only reproductions in specific and modified forms of the forces which primarily pertain to them.  


pg. 13-14

Planets are the more immediate parents and dependencies of still more diversified and minute systems of circular development, which include stock movements, wheat movements, cotton movements, in price as well as in volume of transactions.  

[Bayer groups these according to categories, according to spheres of energy/influence type.]

pg. 14

Diurnal circle.

About circles within circles, or wheels within wheels:

"The minutest of these circles of movement and development are, in some sense, dependent upon greater circles; and those, in like manner, are included in and dependent upon still greater circles, thus forming circles within circles, or wheels within wheels. "

"All are included in the Great Circle, which comprehends all movements and developments in the Universe from its periphery to its centre, from teh whole imaginable vortex of Being to a single atom of matter, and from teh origin to the very end of all material things.  Since it has been shown that there is no beginning and no end to the Universe, but merely eternal revolution, then by speaking of beginning and end, is meant a comprehensive circle."


pg. 16

The whole solar system is swept around a great common center, which is so distant that a single orbital revolution cannot be achieved in a period less than 18 million years.  Such a revolution would constitute a Great Year, or a Great Circle of our own solar system.  

[rluu: Time factor of 18 ?]


Law of sympathy.  (Changes in one circle in the system will have a coordinated or co-related effect on other circles in the system).

pg. 18

Diurnal motion.

Fixed stars: Stars that have the same relative positions.
Wandering stars: Planets.

Planets listed:
1) Mercury
2) Venus
3) Mars
4) Jupiter
5) Saturn
6) Uranus
7) Neptune
8) Sun
9) Moon

pg. 19

Moon completes one revolution around the Earth in about 27 days.
Revolution of the Sun around the Earth is about 365 days.

[rluu: Time factor of 27 ?]
[rluu: Time factor of 365 ?]

360 degrees of a circle.

[rluu: Time factor of 360 ?]

12 divisions of the ecliptic called signs of the Zodiac.

The count begins at the fixed star gamme in teh sign of Aries, which point is called 0 degrees of Aries.


Comets: Hairy stars.

pg. 21

The Bible is an astrological book.  It contains astrological laws.

Take maps and countries, and construct these palces as being parts of the division of the Zodiac.

Bayer says he will show the astrological laws which come from the Bible later [in this book].


Human beings are planets of infinitesimally small size.  They also move in ellipses.


pg. 22

Opportunity represents the time factor of the enterprise, more or less.  (The right time to start or act).

pg. 24

1500 brokers.
[rluu: Is this number important?  Time factor?]

pg. 25

Dollar amounts on this page:
  2, 5, 50, 150

[rluu: Are these numbers important?  Time factors?]

pg. 27-28

July 1, 1932 to July 10, 1932.     [Buy]
September 1, 1932.                 [Sell]
November 3, 193?  [Probably 1932]  [Buy]   [This day was the bottom in stocks.]

pg. 29

Favored stocks (loved by the public) are commonly termed "Leaders".  These are the stocks to trade and they should be traded until they cease to be leaders, at which time commitments must be transfer to the coming leaders.

pg. 30

Reference to 4 rules listed on page 12.  

[rluu: I think pages are not numbered correctly in the PDF I have.  Original document page numbers were probably different.]

[rluu: Numbers 4 and 12.]

pg. 33

Bible: The book interpreting universal motion.

The small, minor moves are all parts of well-defined larger moves, cycles within cycles, wheels within wheels.  

*******************************************************************************
*** Bayer says the main laws to be explained hereafter are the "Time Laws". ***
*******************************************************************************

Price laws are also explained very carefully, but they must be subordinated to the time laws.  If the time is fixed for a change, the price of the stock must be automatically near a top or near a bottom, as the case may be.

pg. 37

[Numbers are given for scaling of charts.]

Make charts on the following time frames:
  - Trading days.
  - Weekly.
  - Monthly.

pg. 38-39

About traditional technical analysis of charts: 
Approximately 10 distinct formations of importantance with hundreds of varieties of each such formation.  These formations are brought about by planetary constellations in teh heavens.  As they change or repeat, the chart picture will change and repeat.  

[rluu: Reference to the number 10.  Time factor of 10 ?]

pg. 39

The missing link is TIME.

pg. 41

[Reference to number "52" in a story.]
[rluu: Time factor of 52 ?]

pg. 43

Sun at 120 deg., 90 deg., or 180 deg., to Uranus causes changes in the market.
[rluu: These numbers probably related to time.]

Wheat needed to sell at 40 cents and not $1.00

[rluu: Time factor of 40 ?]
[rluu: Time factor of 100 ?]

pg. 44

Florida land bubble: 1913 to 1922.
[rluu: 1922 - 1913 = 9 years.]

[rluu: 
  1913 + 84 = 1997
  1922 + 84 = 2006

Numbers of Bayer's friend:
10 lots    [sold]
3 houses   [sold]

4 lots     [left to be sold]
2 houses   [just being finished]


Double-top formation in stocks:
September 1929 to April 1930.

pg. 45

Tuplip bulb craze in Holland shortly after the Thirty Year War, 1618-1648.

Top in stocks:    September 3, 1929.
Bottom in stocks: Early July, 1932.

pg. 46

The market broke for 2 1/2 years (2.5 years).



Bible information for a big cycle of stock movements or any other movements:
Genesis chapter 10
Genesis chapter 5

Adam cycle is 930 years (degrees) long.

After Adam cycle is in operation for 130 degrees, he begot Seth, another cycle makes its appearance and therefore is in operation already 800 degrees before the former dies out.

Jupiter is the planet that is meant by Adam.
Dividing 930 by 30 gives you the answer how long the Adam cycle must be.
[rluu: 930 / 30 = 31.  Interestingly, 100 - 31 = 69.]

Large time spaces to go through the family of Adam before we arrive at Noah.

Noah, being the same as Adam, i.e. Jupiter, another cycle starts that ends with Abraham.  

Abraham again is Jupiter.  

pg. 47

St. Matthew, Chapter 1:
Subsequent cycles of Jupiter, beginning with Abraham.  
St. Matthew 1:17, says 14 Jupiter cycles up to David, 14 more up to teh Babylonian time, and 14 more up to Christ, making a total of 42 cycles.  

The repetition therefore runs in 14 cycles of Jupiter, at which time elapsed we look for similarities of repetition of movements.

[rluu: 14 + 14 + 14 = 42 cycles.]

pg. 48

Stocks: 
Bottom: June 2, 1932
September 1932, prices had gone back up to levels in March 1932.
6 month reaction into March 1933.
The public bought in June 1932; they bought in September.

On March 4th, the day after the market closed, Bayer sent a telegram, Markets re-opening will be the top... then it will sell off till March 30, followed by big advance.

March 15, 1933, markets reopened with gap upwards.
Markets went downwards until March 30, 1933.


Bayers sayd this book [Time Factors In The Stock Market] has all the methods used to find the moves he called except one method.

pg. 51

Top: September 1932.
Bottom: March 1933.
Top: July 1933.

pg. 53

28 times of Ecclesiastes chapter 3.

Ecclesiastes 3:6: 
  A time (#17) to GET.
  A time (#18) to LOSE.
  A time (#19) to KEEP.
  A time (#20) to cast away.

There are only 28 times for a specific reason, and not 25 or 26 times.  Bayer says but this belongs in another field and must be passed over.

[rluu: 28 * 360 degrees = 10,080 degrees.]


pg. 54

"Time cycles", which we may call "vibrations".

"Very small moves of eighths and quarters, joiningi one another, causing occasional irritations and happiness.  These produce cycles within cycles."

pg. 55

Try to measure the market's vibration in a scientific way, and eliminate your own vibrations as much as possible (i.e. your opinions).

Once these vibrations are calculated and plotted, the only thing that remains to be done is to buy stocks when the markets's vibration indicate a positive action and sell stocks when they indicate a negative action.  This sounds very easy, provided you have a point of beginning.  

pg. 57

144 years

[rluu: Time factor of 144.]


Stocks are traded fully 24 hours a day, even though actual transactions can only occur during specific market-open hours.  Gaps int eh market prove this contention.

pg. 59

$1,700

[rluu: Time factor of 17 ?]


pg. 59-61

Story of Durable Malloy that parallels stock market movements:

  - Happened 2 years ago, in New York.
  - $1700
  - Durable Malloy: 
     - Feeble.
     - Whiskey
     - Tainted oysters and sardines, in which bits of 
       chopped tin had been placed.
     - Wood alcohol.

  - Drove to Pelham Parkway (77 or 7 + 7 = 14)
  - Durable Malloy was lifted out of the car and supported in the
    middle of the road by 2 men.
  - Another [man] backed the 2 blocks to get a runnign start at his target.
  - A woman was watching the proceedings from a window.
  - They drove to Gunhill Road (79 or 7 + 9 = 16)
  - The men supporting Malloy released their grip too soon and Malloy
    leapt out of the path of the automobile.
  - They tried it again and Malloy was knocked down and run over easy.

  - Next day:

    - One of the participants looked for an item concerning the death
      of Malloy, but none was found.

    - One of the witnesses discovered Malloy was in the hospital,
      rapidly recovering from injuries.

    - They obtained a substitute a deputy Mallow, and John Murray, another bar room derelict, was stupefied with drink in the speak-easy.  Malloy's papers and 17 cents were thrust in his pocket, and they set out with him to repeat the experiment.  Success came at last.  

  - The trio was executed at Singsing.

  - Malloy lived about another year and died of natural causes.

pg. 61

Stock AC:
June 1932, all stocks made new bear market lows, but AC was able to run up 40 points inside 3 days, from 37 to 77, while at the end of October 1935, when the general market was strong and moving upward, this stock took an 8 point dive to 35.

Numbers:
   3 days

  End of October  1935.


[rluu: The above are time factors?]

pg. 62

Stay away from the tape.  

Thoughts, decisions and judgements need time and quiet, and must be mulled over and the wheat separated from the chaff.

pg. 63

[Bayer talks about our lack of free will, and how all actions are pre-destined.]


10 and 20 thousand dollars a share.

[rluu: Numbers: 10 and 20.]

September 1929

In Bayer's advice written December 12, 1933, he said the market would drop until December 21, 1933 and then rally to December 30, 1933.  This was calculated with planetary movements.  


pg. 64

Everything that exists issues force.  What sort of force?  Sun energy.  The energy fo the Sun permeates all space belonging in this system.  Every particle within this system is saturated with solar energy.  

It contains electricity and magnetism, two opposing forces, power against resistance, attraction against repulsion, creating unbroken motions, swings and vibrations.  Since the Sun sends forth energy constantly, attraction and repulsion of every atom must take place.  In this way, the Sun is our electro-magnet, our giver of life, without which nothing would be possible.  

Everything is alive; what we call death cannot be found in this world.  All is change, revolution, return, evolution.

pg. 65-66

As each body receives Sun energy, this same body must, according ot the law of attraction and repulsion, also radiate such energy in turn, only in modified form; the body will mix the received energy with its own radiation and radiate this mixture to its surroundings.  This energy has been, so to say, revamped.  

Example of of this radiation is called "aura".

pg. 66

90 degrees between Jupiter and Mars.

[rluu: Time factor of 90 ?]

pg. 67

100 feet
1500 feet

[rluu: Numbers 100 and 1500.]

END OF PART ONE.

Part 2.

pg. 68

Methods based on planetary motions to forecast stock movements and those of the various commodities.



Numbers: 7, 12, 40, 70

[rluu: Perhaps time factors.]


Moses remaining 40 days on Mount Sinai, means Jupiter moving forward 40 degrees in teh heavens.  

Revelations and Daniel uses the phrase:
"time and times and half a time".

Revelations 12:14:
"And the woman was given two wings of a great eagle, that she might fly into the wilderness, into her place where she is nourished for a time, and times, and half a time, from the face of the serpent.


"Eagle" == Scorpio.

pg. 69

"woman" in this case, represents the Sun.
"wilderness" == Leo.

"time and times and half a time" == 122 and 1/2  [According to Bayer.]

Biblical circle is not 360 degrees, but is 368 deg 10 min 48 sec.
