Notes from Bayer's Previews.

Notes below were taken July 18, 2013.

##############################################################################

Bible words:

pg. 106: "speak" in the Bible means "move".
pg. 106: "writing" in the Bible means to draw pictures (which ones?).

##############################################################################

pg. 2-3

One cycle, a bull or bear movement, is represented by the 22 letters of the Ancient Hebrew alphabet.

The beginning is Tav, and the end is Alpeh.  That is one complete cycle.

Tav to Aleph = Bear market.
Aleph to Tav = Bull market.

##############################################################################

pg. 17

"When It Rains, It Pours"
Short story written in code of the cycle.

rluu: Read and study this story carefully.

##############################################################################

pg. 29

Introductory information on the Bible and coding.

Know what is ONE YEAR that is always quoted in the Bible.  

Find the beginning, and the timing.
This point is the beginning of a New Era.

Jacab sleeps under the heavenly ladder on the earth.  This ladder reached to heaven (Genesis 28).

Highlights (given by Bayer):
1) The bible is the book explaining the effects of planets.
2) The effect can never be obtained with what is commonly known as astrology.
3) The names quoted in the Bible can be angles or points of conjunctions.
4) The meaning can only be discovered by discarding completely everything that is shown in astrology books, excepting the names of the planets.
5) Find out what is ONE YEAR that is always quoted int he Bible.  Then he can start to build the house which does not take long to do after that, because by that time he has gone through the Bible a hundred times "a-hunting".
6) The heiroglyphics of Egypt, the Mohammedan Koran, the Jewish Scriptures, the Christian Scriptures are all one and the same: works that explain the effects of planets to later generations.
7) Every word fo the Bible is absolutely true and in its righ tplace; it contains not one unnecessary word.

##############################################################################

pg. 45

"talk" means movement.

Aesop's Fables.

pg. 46

Why do we use a sun year?  Why is it not appropriate to use a Mercury year, or a Jupiter year, or a Saturn year?  Or some other planetary year?

Moon causes tides.

10 ounces of our brains.

pg. 47

22 Hebrew letters in a spiral spider web.
Mr. Mars.

##############################################################################

pg. 54

Old text books on astrology:
1) The Bible and all those works, which are called Scriptures.
2) All the Egyptian writings on papyri, on tablets or on tombs.
3) All the old tales (Maerchen) such as the 7 Dwarves.
4) All the stories of 1001 Nights and other stories from Arabia.
5) All the myths, be they Greek or Roman.


Actions (verbs are planetary movements):
- Beginning: 2 persons, simple plot to establish the planetary positions.
- move
- cry = move retrograde
- marry
- make trips
- laugh
- plough the field

Which planet is indicated by the name given tot he person.  

Market movements can be traced when we follow Harun Arraschid of the 1001 Nights.

##############################################################################

pg. 59 

"The Classic Myths" based on "Age of Fables" published in 1855, Bayer's copy printed in 1899.

##############################################################################

pg. 61-62

Subjects of study required:

- German, and some medieval German.  This applies to all Scriptures including the Oriental "Maerchen".

A little bit of everything in the way of:
- Sciences
- Physics.  You need physics to learn about motion in general, particularly the parts called mechanics and optics.
- Chemistry.  Recognize the fact that certain atoms join together and others just simply won't join.  
- Astronomy.  You need to know this like ABC's, because on planetary motion everything is built.
- History.  You need ancient history because most of it must be astrologically interpreted.  
- Biology.  Botany we must not forget either.  There are hundreds of trees and flowers, shrubs and perennial flowers mentioned, each for a purpose of its own.  Beware if you dont' know what kind of grass barley is!
- Languages, modern and ancient.  As many as possible should be mastered so that the relationship of the words of various languages can be compared.  German AND Medieval Geramn.  He compares it to medieval English or French.  [pg. 62, 63]
- All possible and impossible systems of astrology.
- Mathematics.  Needed to calculate astronomy.
- Studied the markets.
- Zoology: to identify the various animals that occur throughout the Scriptures.  You must know their habits else the name of an animal does not impart to you the hidden meaning that has some connection witht he habit and action of such animal.
- Geography.  You not need the beautiful maps joined to Bibles, wherein the various places of the Zodiac are put into Palistine, but use maps showing the world and the cities around the year 1400.   You must know in which country they are located.

Eternal patience is also required.


Works that discuss the Laws of Motion of everything:
- Bible
- The Jewish Scriptures.
- The Oriental Tales.  These are the product of Southern Germany and "made in Germany" produced somewhere in Upper Bavaria, around Wasserburg or Wessobrunn, and never have been Arabia.  
- Koran of Mohammed.


pg. 64

For 1001 Nights:
"words"    means "rules"
"lasting"  means "true"
"arrow"    means "the lines"
"poisoned" means "false"

pg. 65

Oriental Tales or Fairy stories:
Each story is one complete course of astrology.  The rules can be delivered quite compactly.

Oriental Tales has 3 stories of Kalenders, 5 stories of the Barbers; they illustrate one signle law in several forms.  

The Adam and Eve story (Slavonic Text of Vitae Adae et Evae) is printed in Pseudepigrapha on 9 pages since on the 18 pages covering the story we have 2 versions printed next ot each other on separate columns.  Nine pages gives in a concentrated form all the secrets of the Universe, if we can read it.  

##############################################################################

pg. 69-70

Story of "blind Baba Abdallah" from 1001 Nights.

Story elements:
- 80 camels split to 40 and 40.
- sign
- burden
- left and right eyes.
- blindness
- God can only bring back eye-sight.

##############################################################################

pg. 71

Another Law Book dealing with motions of the Universe:
Thijl Uilenspiegel and Lamme Goedzak
[Bayer says Thijl Uilenspiegel is actually a Dutch or Flemish work, and to use a Dutch dictionary for examination of words given in original Dutch.]

pg. 72

Talmud is a book of syntax, the correct book of exact rules and of its exceptions.

The pseudepigraphic works are essays of various sorts and the Scriptures are the regular, approved handbooks.

##############################################################################

pg. 74-75

Fattening up is the market prices going up higher.
Getting lean is the market prices going down.

Story examples:
- Red Riding Hood and the Witch.
- Fat and lean years of Egypt.

pg. 75

The laws are mentioned in hundreds of ancient works, such as:
- Bible
- the Myths
- Fabled 1001 Nights
- Decameron / Decamerone
- Egyptian "Book of the Dead"
- Talmud
- Al Koran

pg. 76

Alibaba and the 40 Thieves is a complete work of how to figure wheat movements.
[Bayer says the story comprises of 28 pages, and contains all that is to be known about wheat prices for any time, any year, any month or day, clearly though concisely written.]


pg. 77

"salt" means "profit".
Footnote vol. III, pg. 221 (3 + 221 = 224 (Venus)):
"Salt indicated by the ancients the symbol of friendship and trust [Bayer: He hits that pretty well]; they used it in all their offerings and alliances [Bayer: Not bad.]."

[rluu: So "salt" means Venus?]

pg. 78

An egg is our number 0, the beginning of all things.  

See how often important movements begin when a planet reaches the "egg" in declination or latitude, or even longitude!


##############################################################################

pg. 83

Moon has a halo.
Sun  has a halo (although not visible to us).

[rluu: See my wikipedia printouts about Halos, and their degree measurements.]

Bayer says inside the halo the planet has no effect, only outside the halo.

Bayer says the halo of the Sun is measured in degrees, so many degrees each side of the Sun (about 10 deg.).  

[rluu: But then Bayer says to see illustration No. 10, on page 74.  10 + 74 = 84.  So the halo is actually 84 degrees !?].

pg. 85-86

Bayer talks about Eclipses formed by the Sun and moon:
[Dates given.]

Bayer talks about halo of an eclipse.

[rluu: I assume the dates given previously illustrate this eclipse halo effect?]

pg. 88

Bayer says:
"Longitude, declination and latitude are separate entities; they give their best results when we are able to use them together (the Trinity)."

Longitude is the primary factor, while declination and latitude are secondary factors.

When the time is right, the price and volume are right automatically.


The law: All motions are made in ellipses.

##############################################################################

pg. 105

Bayer says:
"The real astrology does not bother much about planets, where they are in teh heaven, but it produces its findings by means of lines (angular lines).  Which lines and what kind of lines they are I shall let you find that out. A hint to the clever is enough."


Bayer says "Love" is a particular planet that showed him the road to the solution.  

[rluu: Is "Love" the Moon?]

pg. 106

Love one discovered doth never or very seldom come to a happy and good end (the work in astrology, once hit right never ends).  

The million and one things influenced by Love have each their own cycle, which must be figured.  

[rluu: Just a guess: The "million and one" is "11" ?]

There is no top, there is no bottom, except by LOVE.  (Vol. 111, 9).
[rluu: 111 + 9 = 120.]

"speak" in the Bible means "move".
"writing" in the Bible means to draw pictures (which ones?).

pg. 107

Bayer prefers the Talmud over the Bible for the laws.
10 volumes.

Chapters of the Talmud are such as:
- Sabbaths
- "on Oaths"
- Blessings
- Day of Atonement
- many others.


These are nothing but subdivisions, the same as used in gramars:
Substantitives, Verbs, Adverbs, and Pronouns.

"Blessings" for example has the meaning: "Pronouns", their individual meanings and "uses".

Just look over the Scriptures and note the immense quantity of pronouns used: you, he, us, ours, and them, to them, for them, at them, above them, with them.  Each pronoun has an individual covered meaning.  The best start any many could get who tries to solve the puzzle, would be to to begin with atempting to solve the meaning of the pronouns.  This approach I know now and wish I had known it several years ago.

pg. 107-108

[Latin-isms]

pg. 108

"I" is the middle the center, while "you" is ahead of this center, and "he" is behind this center.  Therefore, knowing constantly the location of the planets by merely using the correct pronoun, it is much more important to know the angle that is formed between them.  

This angle is expressed with the verb, with the right verb, which always means the same size angle and no other size.  


In Latin, they could place the planet (the personal pronoun) in front as well as in back.  


pg. 109

What is Homer, what is Nibelungenlied?  What are all the books on the Index of the Roman Church, prior to the year 1600 ?  They are all astrological grammars.  Rome does not want anyone to get too close towards recognizing laws, but "forbidden fruit tastes best"!


Why do Kings in Egyptian pictures always carry a stick?  You solve the meaning of that stick and you have solved the puzzle of motion.  "In the balance shall they be weighed"!  By the way, "balance" does not mean "Libra" by any means.  

##############################################################################

pg. 113-114.

Bayer says a plot of time to longitude does not help us very much to discover such pictures.

However, a lot more is available when we plot Declination and Latitude of planets, drawn with the Sun as the main line around whose declination and latitude all others wind around.  When using declination, we must not forget that the Sun declination moves on a fixed angle of 23 27', so that the winding occurs along this angle.  


Several commodities must be plotted because we have to try to locate stations in teh heaven such as Chicago, or Omaha.


Careful notations of the effect of each of the crossings have to be made right into the charts, whether the approach of the line was from north or south or from south to north, or whether they were made form "half-way" points, i.e. whenteh planets had not reached their extreme declinations or latitudes, but turned halfway.  This latter condition you will see quickly when you plot them on charts.  Each time the effect is differe,t but the effect once established does repeat well.  Each planet, of course has its own effect again at such crossings.  For example, Saturn crossing southward over Sun in Declination has always one effect upon wheat, but quite a different effect compared to Mercury or Venus doing it.  The slower moving planets have more weight than teh flighty ones.  While mercury nad Venus cause hte so-called "jiggles", Saturn and Jupiter cause trends.

I have not quoted all the points that need watching after the chart is completed, but suffice it to say that when they turn at extreme low delcination or latitude, or extreme high points, or at half-way points, important changes also come forth.

A congregation of several crossings within a day means a real important change, especially so when heavy planets are involved.  They are far apart in time, but when they come they give major changes.
