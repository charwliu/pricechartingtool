Notes on "Turning Four Hundred Years of Astrology To Practical Use and Other Matters" by George Bayer.

rluu: Notes taken April, 2013.  

Note:  The notes below are not complete of the whole book, but rather, notes of my reading as I jumped around reading the book.  See my binder of the print pages of this book, where I highlighted and wrote a lot more in the actual pages.  In my binder I write a lot more of the connections between pages, although this document here might still be a good resource.  

##############################################################################

On the word "truth":

pg. 144 says "Believing means to take something for granted without knowing the cause or, the truth."  [rluu: "Truth" means the cause?]

pg. 180 says "There are but few who trade in markets and who on this account do have the means to hit upon truths, which otherwise never would appear.  They are the "Only Ones"!!.  [rluu: "Only Ones" means something, does it mean "11"?]


##############################################################################

Important pages:

pg. 131: Introduction.

pg. 132: From the Old Masters. 
         First three lines of Goethe's poem.
         [rluu: I think Bayer gives the whole cycle here.]

pg. 142: The "I" and the "O"

pg. 163: "MAKE MY WAY STRAIGHT"  [Number 63 is emphasized?  22 + 41 = 63].

pg. 171: The rest of Goethe's poem.  (All 10 lines).  
         Reference to the first 3 producing "them all"
         Number 22.
         [pg. 183 says this page explains how the outside world connects 
          with that of man.]
         This page referrs to 36 Volumes in Volume III, page 22,
           which I think is pointing us to page 122 for all the numbers.

pg. 172: Star Student.

Introduction to Part I and Part II has this quote of the Al Koran of Mohammed:
"Ye have also in cattle an example of instruction:
we give you to drink of that which is in their bellies, a liquor between digested dregs and blood, namely pure milk.  And of the fruits of palm trees and of grapes, ye obtain an inebriating liquor, and also good nourishment.  

Verily herein is a sign unto people to understand.".

Al Koran of Mohammed
Chapter 16



Foreword date is: December 30, 1943.

pg. 3-4:
Bayer mentions the directions:
Midday = South point
Midnight = North point
Morning = East point
Evening = West point

NE, SE, NW, and SW are between this points.
Bayer mentions smaller divisions also: 
  16th division.
  32nd division.

pg. 6

In our astrological work we sometimes use heliocentric motion of planets to figure wheat or cotton prices or the prices of some other commodities, in some cases also for stocks, but the methods which are taught in this work consider only geocentric positions of the planets.  

[rluu: Bayer may be lying here.]

pg. 7

The mean length of one degree of a Meridian in longitude is 69.048 miles.

pg. 8

Ancient writings, which are practically all texts from periods prior to 1500, only talked about astrology, written in covered language.


pg. 8-9

"Learn the three R's."
[rluu: Is this referring to "are", "our", and "hour"?]

Numbers given in the text: 
  50 pupils
  18th year
  50%
  Some 10% to 15%, estimated roughly.
  600 to 800 years prior to the 20th century.

pg. 9

The subject of these ancient books was almost always about Gods and their doings.  The subject treated was constantly about astrology, meaning the laws how planets govern human beings.

Hundreds of books of Chinese, Egyptian, Greek and Roman origin treat the subject of astrology.


The knowledge or meaning which the Ancients put into their books has not been lost.  

These people knew the laws that were contained in these old texts:  
  Shakespeare, Goethe, Balzac

Emanual Swedenborg's writings are on astrology.  He had all the rules solved that govern everybody.  His works make up about 20,000 pages.

Numbers given in the text: 
  50 pages.  
  10 pages.  

pg. 11

[Tables of Planet orbits, motions, etc.]

pg. 13

After 3 or 4 years have rolled by [of gathering aspect data], you will have gathered enough material for interpretation of aspects of any sort and description, as they act on your person which no text could supply.

pg. 14-15

[Conversion tables given.]

pg. 16

We have to put ourselves as the center of the universe.  We, individually, are the IT.  [Reference to Fig 1 on page 10.  This figure has "Man" written in the middle of a circle, and outside the circle is written "Universe".]


Time periods for planets to move around our earth (i.e. around ourselves):
  - Sun, Venus andMercury: 1 year.
  - Mars: 2.5 years
  - Jupiter: 12 years
  - More distant planets: as much as 100 years.

There is a certain regularity in their movements.  Even though it may require thousands of years, a very same condition in the Universe with all the planets should occur again.  This we would then call a complete cycle of identical repetition.  
[rluu: COR = "Cycle of Repetition"]

"I believe it all depends upon the right beginning."

pg. 16-17

Story for the fast students:

  Course last for 3 years consecutively, 
    cannot use what he learend for want of experience.

  Bayer studied French for 9 years.

  Party at an "adjoining table" speaking also French,
    but Bayer could not understand.

  The reason he could not understand after 9 years of language learning,
    was because the ears were not accustomed to hear the French sounds
    "regularly joined together" in normal conversation.  

  After that episode, it took about 3 months to understand.


[rluu: I think French is a codeword for heliocentric astrology.  These time periods are probably important.]

[rluu: Is "ears" important in the above story?]

pg. 17

24 hours
A day or two after
12 days difference.
'When I erected the chart, his "face" appeared.'

pg. 17-18

How to tell when someone is born:

Day time: Right hand above the left hand.
Night time: Left hand above the righ thand.
Midnight or noon: Clasped hands with fingers interlocked.  Their involuntary action is to sit with their fingers dovetailed.


[rluu: I think Bayer is showing the cycle structure in this part.  There are 5 fingers, 4 + the thumb.]

pg. 18

Various influences as codewords, as the days roll by in small events:
  - Hungry
  - Thirsty
  - Sleepy
  - Laugh
  - Itchy (Scratch our back)
  - Feel dirty, so we want to wash ourselves.

Trip from New York to California, subject to:
1) Hungry
2) Thirsty
3) Happy
4) Sad
5) Itchy
etc.

Major travel aspect does not exclude the smaller aspects to work at the same time.  In case a major influence of Mars becomes active, it would mean a major excitement at the same time minor influences remain active just the same.  

[rluu: Mars is the major travel aspect.]



For one day:
  - Legs/walking
  - Hearing
  - Seeing/looking
  - Smelling
  - Tasting

Walking after a smell.
Stumble over something and fall.

Notes on Part III: Advanced Astrology and Philosophy

pg. 131

Introduction:

Part I, a revised edition of the Five-Fold Horoscope published i 1937, had been completed in May, 1941.

Two and one half years, one full Mars motion around the Zodiac, have passed, when Part I was completed.

Greek spoken 3,000 years before Christ.


Cling to the Five-Fold Horoscope as your guide, to lead you to make your living.  

Paracelsus, with the aid of his astrological laws, performed many "unbelievable" cures.  He was a clever astrologer who pulled away from usual astrology.

Introduction is dated:
Carmel - by the Sea, Calif.
December 30, 1943.

pg. 132

Quote of the first 3 lines of Goethe's Divan, Hafis Nameh II, poem 10.

The first three lines are about words meaning more than one thing.

Make sure to read only the literal translations.


Within one year.
"Quarter" issue, until finally the book will not even sell at 25 cents and is sold out for a song as "remainder".  

[rluu: I think Bayer is trying to mention something about the time period 1.25 years.]

pg. 133

nickel issues.



Other writers:
Heinrich Heine's works.
Works of Friedrich Nietsche, especially his Zarathustra.

Bayer says that both writers are basically the same.

Bayer says to include authors contained in "Bohn's Classical Library", which specializes in the Masters Works.

Other writers and works:
Goethe's work "On Colors"
Children's Stories of Grimm's Fairy Tales
The Rattenfaenger von Hameln.

Swedenborg's works, which comprise some 50 volumes [in Bayer's edition].

pg. 134

First year after the publication of Swedenborg's "Celestial Arcana", it sold but 3 copies.  

Now-a-days between 10 and 20 thousand are sold each year.  

[rluu: First year has 3, every year after has between 10 and 20.]

German work: Nibelungen Lied

The works had a small beginning, and only grew later on.


##############################################################################

Quick notes of places where words and topics are mentioned.

pg. 135

Two types of books:
  - Good book:      takes the "right time" and "much time"
  - Ephemeral book: takes "any time" and "little time"

pg. 136-137

"Cut" open to the 6th or 8th page.
[rluu: Cut to 6 or 8 pieces?]

100 volumes (100 years)
2 of these are special and have notes in them:
1) explained one sentence after the other. [rluu: i.e. in sequence].
2) Utilizes a certain girl.  Boy of 10 or 12 years, has entry on the "front page": 5 cents (15 deg?), and 6 bits (12.5 cents, 37.5 deg?).


pg. 137

400.
50-60 thousand
27 or 28 letters to form words.

pg. 138
400 condensed to 60.
5 scales or 5 octaves

"Bread" mentioned in 6 languages, related to octaves.  (3 days and 3 nights).
"makes sentences to join thoughts together".
"middle octave"

pg. 139

Marrying
Nature "marks" him, so that their qualities remain through later modulations.

30 years or longer.

The qualities acquired in youth and in original surroundings mark him.  Let us not forget their accent [original vibration when modulated] when they speak the acquired or adopted tongue [modulated frequency, or next octave?].

Colors:
  - Black
  - Blue
  - White

[rluu: Color is a modulation of light frequency.]


Often times, especially Sundays.

The cut, color and quality, resembles those which they used to wear in the old country.


Animals are at different tunings?

Animals in groups:
  - White butterfly.
  - Beetle.
  - Worm
  
Animals/flowers in groups:
  - Palm
  - Violet
  - Pansy


pg. 140

8 different breads [groups of 5 octaves?] are given.
THe last bread is unclean, acting like a pig.

50 varieties of palms.

"Golden middle way"


"Languages" played on the organ:
2 hand claviatures, with 5 octaves each
3rd claviature in the form of foot pedals.

2 dozen knobs = 24 knobs.

9 years on "the side".
Get even with them some day.

[Octave or cycle is completed elsewhere at a later date.]

Name "Julius" is mentioned here on pg. 140, which is a connection to "Caesar" on page 165.


pg. 141

4 cleffs of music: 
  - Violin key:   small jiggles
  - Alto key:     small swings of a few days
  - Tenor key:    a week to 6 weeks
  - Bass key:     major bull and bear cycles.

Sometimes it is silent, meaning no trend.


For Violin, there is a SIGN: half moon with a dot below the moon.
It is the sign to hold on until the orchestra leader gives the sign to stop playing.

Usually the pair of cymbals (2 round brass plates) strikes at that time.  This represents the last explosion just before the "nut cracks", i.e. the Mark begins its nose-dive.  [Reference to that phase as mentioned in Egg of Columbus.]


Various strengths in music (their variations in the market):
1) piano:        quiet markets
2) forte:        strong markets.
3) mezzo-forte:  normal markets
4) rallentando:  markets increasing in [trading?] volume
5) diminuendo:   decreasing markets
6) capricioso:   jumpy markets

Music keeps playing during these variations.


Play first violin.

pg. 142

Symphonic music has several portions or parts to take care of all conditions:
[All market conditions are covered by these phases]
  - Waltzes: Wavy-waving effect
  - Marches: Goose-step form.
  - Jazz:    It's own form.

Of the last 3 names, no American could swallow them for breakfast, lunch, and dinner, bu thet former, I feel sure, we could accept at any time.  


pg. 142

The "I" and the "O".
Reference to Paraclesus, Vol.I 190.  [190]

"Nature"
"Love and Wisdom" of Swedenborg.


"I": Man, body.

"O": God, soul.

Question: How many commandments were givecn on Mt. Sinai.  Call this mountain "Sin" & "I" (sie & Ich = "Her" and "Me"!).


Bayer says the BIG SECRET can be yours if you solve it now.

The word "breathed" contains the idea of a wave, a ring or motion, as can be seen when one exhales on a cold day.

The word "living" was subjoined to the word "soul" gives us the idea that there must be some other sort of soul, a dead soul.  

"Devil" or "Satan" == The dead soul.

"About this later on." [Bayer says..., but doesn't say more.]

Components of the soul:
  - 5 senses
  - Conscience
  - Sleep

Character is not part of the soul, because the soul is the invisible.  

pg. 143

[Reference to Geothe quote in the beginning [pg. 132] that a word means more than one thing.]

Therefore, the "invisible" soul is something tangible anyhow, merely to distinguish that what is obvious, compared to something that is hard to see with the eyes.  The body anyone can see, but to see the soul is hard.  


In the spring season, plants come up in this order:
  1) Weeds
  2) Grass
  3) Shrubs
  4) Trees
[rluu: Are these connected to each of the seasons correspondingly?]


Festivals were fixed for certain dates of the year, only one of them was moveable, Easter.

Jewish New year always falls into the end of September.


Various religions seem to represent nothing but different octaves of our piano, the year, all being the same as far as the length of the octave is concerned but different in the wave lengths of their sound.

One moveable feast: Easter
Possible dates are between: March 25 and April 20, or within the space of one Moon's rotation.  First Sunday after the New Moon.  

Jews have 39 laws, one forbidden law which was slipped in "by mistake" and was mixed up with the 38 good ones.  So that, to be sure, nothing evil would happen to the believers, on account of that stray sheep, they forbade the entire 39 laws, including the 38 good ones, also termed them bad.  

This is what is called in German, "Spitzfinding", or in English: "Find the point".

[rluu: Bayer is saying for us to ask ourselves why is he saying what he is saying.  Why 39 laws, 38, 1 evil?]

pg. 143-144

All religious festivals as points on our piano, calling the entire length of all octaves one year, and space them accordingly, we obtain divisions of the year that do not look as if they were divisions like Spring, Summer, Fall and Winter, but they are supposed to represent a cycle, the cycle of the life of Jesus Christ.  

pg. 144

Christmas Day.  (Old Style or New Style?)
Died on Good Friday.  
Came out of the grave at Easter.
Pentecost

After Pentecost, was void or barren of events, unlesss we consider that one of the dates is to be jumped for once, so that Christmas to be on one year, then his life to last through one year without an Easter, then skip the next Christmas and end at Easter.

Then after Easter we have late in May: Ascension day.


This would give us 2 rounds, or at least one and 1 and 1/2 rounds in the Zodiac or in the motion of the Sun through the Zodiac.


[rluu: See pg. 166 about 1/2 + 1 parabolic curves (totals to 1.5 parabolic curves).  This may be about the same thing.  Note 166 - 144 = 22.]

[rluu: I think the parabolic curves here are related to the "Gordian knot" that Bayer mentions as a puzzle.  I think this is the puzzle of squaring the circle.  After the circle is squared, then we can look at it from the perspective of cities, fish net, and the spiral (spider web, or square of 9).]

The "cause" == the Truth.

pg. 145

Two groups:
 - Those who use the Sun as being the influencer.
 - Those who claim the Moon to be the It.  ["It"!, see pg. 183]

One language [octave] grows into another, one octave into another, so it was with this study [book].

pg. 146

Octaves fade out, one by one also.

60 Volumes.  [60 years? 6 octaves?]

##############################################################################

Find that foundation which supports all houses, including their roof:
Find: 
  - Base [pg. 146]
  - Flag pole, [pg. 146, 163 ("lines")] with the
  - Small flag [pg. 146, 163 ("Bavarian flag")].

By gradual elimination of ideas, the posibility of eliminations dwindled down to few, so that finally one single foundation would eventually be found that should prove to be solid.

[rluu: See the notes in this document about building a house or temple.]


[rluu: Theory: I think the "base" is the major major low of all time.  It might also be the most recent Major low.  Thus the flag pole is from the base to the major high, and the flag is Gann square that is like a matrix that overlays the price. ]

pg. 163: Combination of lines, like the old Bavarian flag used to be.  Criss cross sort of squares, "Rauten" they called those squares, each line of the square was of equal length, but the angles of the form were not equal.  [pg. 163]


##############################################################################

pg. 147

Building houses or temples:

A small builder may start building a house and live in it while he builds a new one.  Then he builds a better one, sells the other and lives in teh new one.  This procedure may keep up, until he has built for himself a big house which is just not for sale.  

20 years mentioned.

pg. 155

Glory and Fame means the top.

Oxen means bull that pushes things contantly uphill without any let off.  It is not natural... these ppl suffer more when it is time for them to take their opposites.


"ballo" meaning to fall or to drop [in the markets.].

pg. 156

"Golden Middle Way".

pg. 157

This book by Bayer is the painting the "Tree of Life".


Money ["Dapanema"] therefore means: Adam & Eve, the good and the evil.


Eve taking the apple means bought stock/commodities right at the top.
Acting like a wild lion is someone who acts with confidence at the top.

pg. 158

The One and Only God, is who makes things live and makes things die.


pg. 159

Unclear if Bayer is saying these are correct or incorrect:

Sun: The "glory and fame" of confidence.
Moon: Supposedly makes things grow.
Noes: Used to forecast events when planets cross over them in angles or by conjunction.


pg. 160

[Abraham-Terah story.]

Abraham speaks of praying to the ONLY One.  [To not use planets, but the LOV method of birth and death.]
He chopped off the hands and feet of all his images.  He says so verbally where he speaks of the destruction of sinful sities of Sodom and Gomorrha, of Ishmael cast off, of the Cities of Sin (two), and the 3 other cities, 5 all told.  

[rluu: How many cities?]

Main meaning of the Bible: Life can be only understood by way of astrology.  Even that is not enough.  

Astrology represents the second story of the Ark of Noah.

Ark of Noah had 3 stories, just like we have Heaven, Purgatory and Hell.

pg. 161

Noah means: "No", don't use your idols [planets], "ah", use the ONLY one [God], and build the Ark with it.  

Look back to 3 days in childhood.

Abraham told Terah to forsake his dead idols.
Terah drops them, starts a new life, and starts building the new idols/Gods.

[rluu: Meaning, Old measurements were dead or no longer valid.  Flood came to wash them away.  At new life (rebirth), start measuring again for planet cycles.]

pg. 162

Numbers given:

28 possibilities
7 "of them"
10 "of them"

Thus: 28, 7, 10


Structures created by the planet cycles are part of the "image" created that was spoken about on pg. 142.


##############################################################################

About the straight way:

To be "saved", follow the straight road.   [pg. 162]

[rluu: I think that means follow the direct planets, i.e. Sun and Moon, which is connected to rebirth.]


Focus on one single thing, upon the Only One, and everything will open up.  [pg. 162]

"Seek ye first the Kingdom of God, and his Righteousness, and all these things shall be added unto you."  (Matthew VI, 33).  [pg. 162]

[rluu: "Righteousness" as the "straight way" ?]

Jesus said, "MAKE MY WAY STRAIGHT".  [pg. 163]

[rluu: Where did Jesus say this?  Find this.]
[rluu: 



pg. 163 talks about a combination of LINES.


##############################################################################

About the FIXED place from which to measure, or from which to expand out:

"Man is BOUND to earth" [pg. 162]

Spider builds his web from the center.  [A spiral]  A spider web looks more like the horoscopal layout with its 12 partitions, with the man in the Center. [pg. 163]

See also the "man/ourselves/it" at the center of the universe (circle) spoken about on pg. 16, and Figure on pg. 10.

Again, Bayer says we are in the center of the universe on [pg. 24].
Measurements given in this area of the text is 22 deg 41 sec.  
[rluu: 24 + 41 = 63.  Is this connected to what Haytham talks about Gann increasing it by 6?  63 + 6 = 69.  Interestingly, maybe page 41 has something to pay attention to?]

12 signs of the zodiac.  To facilitate such figuring, one certain place had to be fixed, once and for all, so as to have a beginning from which to measure.  [pg. 175]

##############################################################################

Lines:

Sardines are caught with big nets, whereas most other fish are caught with a line.  [pg. 163]


A [fish] net is a combination of lines.  [pg. 163]


Note that first 3 lines of Goethe's Divan, Hafis Nameh II, poem 10.  [pg. 132]

The rest of the lines of the poem (total of 10 lines) are on [pg. 171].

Mother and 2-year old child reach the "End of the line" and the child gives a strange motion, which revealed all she wanted to do.  [pg. 163].

[rluu: I think Bayer is trying to describe the "warning signal" that Gann talks about, which gives a warning that the move is about to end.]

##############################################################################

Cities:

Cities have a relationship with "fishes".  [pg. 163]

Cities are in squares.   [pg. 163]

[rluu: Is there a connection with the spiral?  Bayer mentions spider web for that spiral.]


Down 3 squares and over 2  [pg. 164]:
[rluu: This distance is sqrt(13), or 3.605551275463989.]

Fish net is many squares. [pg. 164]


##############################################################################

pg. 165

Caesars (Bull Markets).  [pg. 165]

Connected to Tessares, or 4.
Thus, 4 bull markets.

Near to this Tessares is the word "Tetrapodos" which means quadruped animal, an animal with 4 legs.  This omits: birds, worms, insects, and fishes. [pg. 165]


##############################################################################

Trumpet is the first part of the tetrapodos.  [pg. 165]

[rluu: Meaning, this is the first part of the [first?] bull market of the 4 bull markets.]

Trumpet means "Oh! Ox", or the market bottom, such as April 1942.  [pg. 165]



pg. 165-166

"Anger" and "pain" are connected to when the market profits or health flows away.

[rluu: Anger first, then Pain?]


pg. 166

Parabolic curves are talked about.  

Below is the text (in two paragraphs) as Bayer describes this:

The syllable "os", covers one full parabolic curve, or outline of the trend, the way the head of an ox is formed.  This means the curve first goes up, then stands still for a moment, and declines again in about the same proportion.

The "Chro" (grow), however, covers only the upward leading part fo the curve.  Therefore, in this case, the ancients did neither use the "filling letters" pi nor kappa as connecting links, whose purpose in the word-separation is to "weaken" the curve as is the case by the insertion of the pi.  In order to strengthen the curve, we would insert the letter kappa as a connecting link.  But in this case they used the filling letter nu, which means: The first half of this word contains an upward-leading arc, then an entire parabolic curve is used once more.  Therefore we obtain here one and one half parabolic curves.

[rluu: Keywords to pay attention to are: "paraolic curve" or "curve", "connecting link(s)", "proportion".  I need to read this section over several more times to try to see what he's trying to say here.]

This puzzle is the "Gordian knot" that is very tough to crack.  

[rluu: This puzzle might be related to squaring the circle.]

The "Gordian knot" is mentioned on page 179 also, related to "corrupt" and "righteous" that is used on page 178.  

On page 178-179, Bayer says that "corrupt" means retrograde and "righteous" means straight or direct.  [rluu: Maybe Bayer is telling the truth here, but perhaps he is lying and it is actually to "corrupt" meaning curved and "righteous" meaning straight, since Bayer quotes Jesus saying "Make my way straight" again.]

pg. 168


To the "ancients whizards", making money [rluu: Is money a codeword for something else?], digging caves to put it into, was not of great importance to them, because the Scropion has a stinger at its end, and that stinger they avoided.  Can you follow me?  

[rluu: The Scorpion's stinger is the end of the bull market?]


Matthew 4, 18
Simon Peter (Sei meine Feder) "be my leader"
Andrew his brother (Andrew being "andere", the other) were casting nets.
So that this "other" was the stinger of the Scorpion.

Bayer says: You can match the rest yourself.  

pg. 169

Period of poetry.  [rluu: Is poetry a codeword for something else?  Is Bayer describing another phase of the market?]


"This one" versus "That one".
[rluu: I think he is talking about the right "eyes".]


Per pg. 170, "Klopstock" is a codeword for the Moon.

pg. 171

This page has the rest of Goethe's poem.  (All 10 lines).  

First 3 lines of "Wink" (A hint) produced "them all" [the last part of this book].  

[rluu: He's saying the last part of this book represents the "7", and the structure of it.  It is said the 3 produced the 7, which produced everything.  Note also that the poem has 7 lines after the first 3 lines, making a total of 10 lines.]


Number 22 referred to.
         This page referrs to 36 Volumes in Volume III, page 22,
           which I think is pointing us to page 122 for all the numbers.


pg. 183 says this page (pg. 172) explains how the outside world connects with that of man.
