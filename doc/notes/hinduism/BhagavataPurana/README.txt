This directory contains my notes for the Bhagavata Purana.

The notes from "The Bhagavata Purana" by Ramesh Menon are referenced by page numbers, [pg. X], etc., and the notes from the Srmiad Bhagavatam as found online is referenced by X.Y.Z where X is the Canto, Y is the chapter, and Z is the shloka.  


At various places online, it is said that the Bhagavata Purana and Srimad Bhagavatam are the same text, but my hard copy of "The Bhagavata Purana" by Ramesh Menon differs from the Srimad Bhagavatam.  Certain whole stories and information are included in one but not the other, and vice versa.
