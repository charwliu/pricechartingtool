Notes on the Indian mythology in Mahabharatha.
##############################################################################

The five Pandavas of Pandu:

Kunti used her boons given to her by Sage Durvasa to bear 3 sons:
1) Yudhishtira (by Lord Dharma)  (Yama rules the South).
     Kunti gave birth to Yudhisthira by invoking the Lord of
     Judgement, Dharma(also known as Yama).

     

     Weapon: Master of using the spear.

     Was forced into exile for 13 years.  

2) Bhima (by Lord Vayu)  (Vayu rules the Northwest)
     (lit. 'terrible', 'awful')
     also called Vrikodara (lit. 'one with a wolf's belly'), because he had a giant appetite.  At times he consumed half of the total food consumed by the Pandavas.  

     His weapon was the mace (club).

     Hanuman was his brother.

     Vasuki bestowed him the immense strength of a thousand elephants.
     He is symbolic of great strength.

     During the 13 year exile of the Pandavas, Bhima played a crucial
     role in the epic in rescuing his brothers every time.

     Bhima defeated Karna 4 times on the 14th day of the Kurushetra war.

     It is claimed that Bhima destroyed six akshauhinis of the Kauravas.

     Eventually Bhima is responsible for slaying all 100 Kaurava
     brothers in the Kurukshetra War.


3) Arjuna (by Lord Indra) (Indra rules the East)
     Literally means 'bright' or 'silver'.
     Weapon: Arjuna, was considered to be the finest archer.  He wielded the Gandiva bow, capable of destroying enemies by the 1000's.  

     The Mahabharata refers to Arjuna by twelve different names:
       
    Arjuna - one of taintless fame and glow like silver
    Phalguna - one born on the star of Phalguna
    Jishnu - conqueror of enemies
    Kiriti - one who wears the celestial diadem, Kiriti, presented by Indra
    Swetavahana - one with white horses mounted to his chariot
    Bibhatsu - one who always fights wars in a fair manner
    Vijaya - victorious warrior
    Parth or Partha - son of Pritha or Kunti. Incidentally his father is the Lord of Heavens, Indra.
    Savyasachi - skillful in using both arms, ambidextrous
    Dhananjaya - one who conquers bows (dhanu) referring to his skills as an archer
    Gudakesa - One who has conquered sleep (gudaka "sleep")
    Kapi Dhwaj - Having flag of Kapi (Monkey) in his chariot (Arjuna's flag displayed an image of Hanuman from a previous encounter)
    Parantap - one who concentrates the most, destroyer of enemies from his concentration


     He is the only undefeated hero in the Mahabharata. Arjuna was an
     avatar of Nara, who along with the avatar of Narayana, Krishna,
     established Dharma in the Dvapara Yuga.

Kunti also shared her boons with Madri, who bore 2 sons, who were twins:
4) Nakula 

     The dark-complexioned Nakula was known to be the most handsome
     person in the Kuru lineage.

     Weapon: In his childhood, along with the other Pandava brothers, Nakula
     mastered his skills in archery under his father Pandu and a
     hermit named Suka at the Satasringa ashram.  Especially, Nakula
     turned out to be an accomplished wielder of the SWORD.

     Nakula was sent west by Yudhisthira to subjugate kingdoms for the
     Rajasuya sacrifice, after crowning as the Emperor of
     Indraprastha.

     It is said that Nakula needed ten-thousand camels to bring the
     entire wealth back to Indraprastha.

     In the 13th year of exile, Nakula disguised himself as an ostler and
     assumed the name of Granthika (within themselves Pandavas called
     him Jayasena) at the Kingdom of Virata. He worked as a
     horse-trainer who looked after horses in the royal stable.

     The flag of Nakula's chariot bore the image of a red deer with
     golden back. Nakula slew Chitrasena, Sushena and Satyasena,
     the sons of Karna.

5) Sahadeva
     (lit. a thousand gods) 

     Weapon: Like Nakula, Sahadeva's core skill lay in the wielding of
     the sword.

     Sahadeva was sent south by Yudhisthira to subjugate kingdoms for
     the Rajasuya sacrifice, after crowning as the Emperor of
     Indraprastha. He was specifically chosen for the south because of
     his expertise with the sword, and because Bhishma opined that
     Southerners are skilled with sword-fighting in general.

     
     In the 13th year of exile, Sahadeva disguised himself as a Vaishya and
     assumed the name of Arishtanemi (within themselves Pandavas
     called him Jayadbala) at the Kingdom of Virata.[6] He worked as a
     cowherd who supervised the maintenance and upkeep of all cows in
     Virata's kingdom.

These two were twins from the physicians to the gods, the Ashwini Kumara twins.

Upon the onset of the Kali yuga and the death of Krishna, Bhima and other Pandavas retired, leaving the throne to their only descendant to survive the war of Kurukshetra, Arjuna's grandson Parikshit. Giving up all their belongings and ties, the Pandavas, accompanied by a dog, made their final journey of pilgrimage to the Himalayas.

Death of Pandu:

After 15 years of celibacy, when Kunti and his sons were away, Pandu suddenly became strongly attracted to his wife Madri. Due to the aforementioned curse, he died after attempting to be intimate with her. Madri, out of repentance and grief, committed sati, burning herself alive on her husband's funeral pyre

Arjuna's bow: Gandiva

The Gandiva (IAST: Gāṇḍīva; Sanskrit: गाण्डीव) is the bow of Arjuna, the hero of the Hindu epic Mahabharata.  When fired, the bow made the sound of thunder.

Per http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/m04/m04043.htm
This weapon equaled 100,000 weapons.  Held by:
1000 years - Shiva
 503 years - Prajapati
  85 years - Sakra
 500 years - Soma
 100 years - Varuna
  65 years - Partha (Arjuna)

[rluu: Sum is: 2253 years.  (2253 / 360) = 6.2583333 circles = 6 circles and 93 degrees.]


These winged arrows, thousand in number, sharp as razors and destructive as the poison of snakes, belong, O Virata's son, to Arjuna. 


[rluu: How long did Arjuna carry his bow Gandiva?  Someone online gave this response, but I need to verify.

"Was carrying his bow Gandiva for 30 years from Pramodoota to Sarvari, and he told Uttara that he will carry it for another 35 years. The next day, on Dark 9th Day, Pandavas declared their identity. Yudhishthira was yrs. 89-10-9 days old "
]



After the war, in Svargarohanika Parva, Agni reappears before Arjuna and asks him to return Gandiva along with the quivers to Varuna. Arjuna had killed Karna, wounded Bheeshma Pitamah badly[Shar Shaiya] with the help of Gandiva.

SECTION XLIII

"Vrihannala said, 'That about which thou hath first enquired is Arjuna's bow, of world-wide fame, called Gandiva, capable of devastating hostile hosts. Embellished with gold, this Gandiva, the highest and largest of all weapons belonged to Arjuna. Alone equal unto a hundred thousand weapons, and always capable of extending the confines of kingdoms, it is with this that Partha vanquisheth in battle both men and celestials. Worshipped ever by the gods, the Danavas and the Gandharvas and variegated with excellent colours, this large and smooth bow is without a knot or stain anywhere. Shiva held it first for a thousand years. Afterwards Prajapati held it for five hundred and three years. After that Sakra, for five and eighty years. And then Soma held it for five hundred years. And after that Varuna held it for a hundred years. And finally Partha,

p. 75

surnamed Swetavahana, 1 hath held it for five and sixty years. 2 Endued with great energy and of high celestial origin, this is the best of all bows. Adored among gods and men, it hath a handsome form. Partha obtained this beautiful bow from Varuna. This other bow of handsome sides and golden handle is Bhima's with which that son of Pritha, that chastiser of foes, had conquered the whole of the eastern regions. This other excellent bow of beautiful shape, adorned with images of Indragopakas, belongeth, O Virata's son, to king Yudhishthira. This other weapon with golden suns of blazing splendour shedding a dazzling effulgence around, belongeth to Nakula. And this bow adorned with golden images of insects and set also with gems and stones, belongeth to that son of Madri who is called Sahadeva. These winged arrows, thousand in number, sharp as razors and destructive as the poison of snakes, belong, O Virata's son, to Arjuna. When shooting them in battle against foes, these swift arrows blaze forth more brilliantly and become inexhaustible. And these long and thick shafts resembling the lunar crescent in shape, keen-edged and capable of thinning the enemy's ranks, belong to Bhima. And this quiver bearing five images of tigers, full of yellowish shafts whetted on stone and furnished with golden wings belong to Nakula. This is the quiver of the intelligent son of Madri, with which he had conquered in battle the whole of the western regions. And these arrows, all effulgent as, the sun, painted all over with various colours, and capable of destroying enemies by thousands are those of Sahadeva. And these short and well-tempered and thick shafts, furnished with long feathers and golden heads, and consisting of three knots, belong to king Yudhishthira. And this sword with blade long and carved with the image of a toad and head shaped as a toad's mouth, strong and irresistible belongeth to Arjuna. Cased in a sheath of tiger-skin, of long blade, handsome and irresistible, and terrible to adversaries, this sword belongeth to Bhimasena. Of excellent blade and cased in a well-painted sheath, and furnished with a golden hilt, this handsome sword belongeth to the wise Kaurava--Yudhishthira the just. And this sword of strong blade, irresistible and intended for various excellent modes of fight and cased in a sheath of goat-skin, belongeth to Nakula. And this huge scimitar, cased in a sheath of cow-skin, strong and irresistible belongeth to Sahadeva.'"
