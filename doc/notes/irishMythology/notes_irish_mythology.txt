The Tuatha Dé Danann brought four magical treasures with them to Ireland, one apiece from their Four Cities.

These four treasures were "jewels".

The 4 island cities were:
1) Murias
2) Falias
3) Gorias
4) Findias

The 4 magical treasures:

1) The Dagda's Cauldron  (from city "Muirias" or "Murias")
      No company ever went away from it unsatisfied.

2) The Spear of Lugh   (from city "Goirias" or "Gorias")
      No battle was ever sustained against it, or against the man who held it.

3) The Stone of Fal   (from city "Falias")
      "Stone of Destiny"

The Lia Fáil was thought to be magical: when the rightful High King of Ireland put his feet on it, the stone was said to roar in joy. The stone is also credited with the power to rejuvenate the king and also to endow him with a long reign. Cúchulainn split it with his sword when it failed to cry out under his protégé, Lugaid Riab nDerg, and from then on it never roared again, except under Conn of the Hundred Battles and Brian Boru.


4) The Sword of Light of Nuada   (from city "Findias")
      No one ever escaped from it once it was drawn from its sheath,
      and no one could resist it. The sword is also described in the
      Tain legend as 'Nuadu's Cainnel' - a glowing bright torch.

Dagda

The Dagda (Proto-Celtic: *Dagodeiwos, Old Irish: Dag Dia, Modern Irish: Daghdha) is an important god of Irish mythology. The Dagda is a father-figure (he is also known as Eochaid(h) Ollathair, or "All-father") and a protector of the tribe. In some texts his father is Elatha, in others his mother is Ethniu. Other texts say that his mother is Danu; while others yet place him as the father of Danu, perhaps due to her association with Brigit, daughter of the Dagda. The Dagda's siblings include the gods Ogma and Lir.

Tales depict the Dagda as a figure of immense power, armed with a magic club and associated with a cauldron. The club was supposed to be able to kill nine men with one blow; but with the handle he could return the slain to life. The cauldron was known as the Undry and was said to be bottomless, from which no man left unsatisfied. Uaithne, also known as "the Four Angled Music", was a richly ornamented magic harp made of oak which, when the Dagda played it, put the seasons in their correct order; other accounts tell of it being used to command the order of battle. He possessed two pigs, one of which was always growing whilst the other was always roasting, and ever-laden fruit trees.
