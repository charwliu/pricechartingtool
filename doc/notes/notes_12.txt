# Notes on the book "12" by Gregory M. Carpenter
##############################################################################

pg. 3.
Respected authors: Gann, Bayer, and Jensen.

pg. 4.
Allan Blakstad: "There is a lot happening at Highs and Lows."

There is information on time cycles in the WITS group and in TTTA, but you won't find them in this (12) book.

It takes faith in yourself (i.e. faith in your abilities), and persistence, to succeed.

pg. 5.
Price is found via the use of time cycles; this is why you need the cycles before you forecast price.

You must know the cycles before you can use the (Gann) squares.

pg. 6.
Your real goal: Understand the cycles in Gann's book: TTTA.

You have to get those cycles; cycles lead you to success.

pg. 7.
This work will teach you how to identify the transiting planets that are affecting your market.  You will learn how to rectify any natal quickly and efficiently.  You will observe how the correct natal produced turns and how you can develop a system for profits on an intermediate level.  You will see in no uncertain terms, the cause of the business cycle and factors that enhance it.  You will learn the factors that are impacting you, creating success or failure depending on your location on the globe.

pg. 11.
Pyramid of the trading field:
  Numbers
  Squares
  Time Factors and Cycles
  Natals
  Aspects and Eclipses.


Gann's TTTA covers the top 5.
Bayer covers Squares, Time Factors, and Natals.
Jensen covers Aspects, Eclipses, Natals and Time Cycles in his writings.
R.T.A. covers aspects and natals.

The squares operate off of Time Cycles, and Number is "shorthand" for these cycles.  Therefore the key is to focus on Time Factors and Cycles.  Information for this is in TTTA by Gann and "Time Factors" by Bayer.  There are also many posts on WITS.

Time Cycles have the problem of not being exact.  This is where the natal comes in handy; it allows you pin the orb down to the exact day or two.  

pg. 12.
Previously they said: To solve orb, look at Jupiter and Saturn 45's.
While you can do it that way, there is a much better way and that is to have a "fixed point" and one planet.  That way you are working with one variable and not two. Active points in a natal count as a fixed point.  

For example:
If the actual point is Saturn transiting over 13 deg 52, but the market turns 13 deg 44, 13 deg 42, and 13 deg 46, thus the market is 'firing' early.  So we createa  'swath' (range) of when the turn will happen.  Saturn transverses these points in one day!

Fusing this principle with Time Cycles is the "Golden Key".

pg. 13
Every stock or commodity responds to ITS OWN aspects.  An aspect between Uranus and Jupiter may turn one market but not another.  So for any market you trade in, you should identify which aspects affect (turn) that market.  You simply go through the aspects one at a time to find which ones work.

List of 'required reading' books:
1) A to Z horoscope Maker Delineator (Llewellyn George)
2) Astro Cycles & Speculative Markets  (Luther Jensen)
3) The Tunnel Thru The Air (W. D. Gann)
4) Kabala of Numbers (Sepharial)
5) Power of Number (Numero)
6) Periodicity (Jos. Buchanan)
7) Key to Bible and Heaven (Ludwig Larson)

pg. 14
Gann used both Helio and Geo.

TTTA: 
Regarding the war in the air:  Look at the dates of battles in the book and compare that to what was occuring in the Dow Jones at that time. 

This book is all about cycles, many different types of cycles and understanding this will save you time.

The way to succeed is to master TTTA.

pg. 15
Regarding software: Solar Fire if you can afford it.
Avoid paying big money for software.  All you need is a cheap ephemeris.

Chiron rules Taurus.
Transpluto rules Virgo.

Always use True Node (and not Mean Node).  

pg. 16.
Use aspect sizes of 15 degree increments.  
(i.e. Increments of 1/24th of a circle).

pg. 19
Books by Johndro to study after learning Astrology and Astronomy:
1) Earth in the Heavens
2) Fixed Stars

It is in these two books that astrology and astronomy come together. 

There is a critical error in Johndro's book "Earth in the Heavens".  He later recanted one aspect of the book.  The Midheaves of the locality charts are FIXED; they are not precessional.  "The actual zodiac used in interpretation is right in step with the equinoctial precession and always has been.  Therefore each country and city has the exact same rulership as it always has."  

From page 51 of "Earth in the Heavens":
"To the dates of eclipses, planetary stationaries, great conjunctions and oppositions, new moons and events."

From page 53 of "The Stars":
Eclipse configurations are the principle indicators of the great events of the year, through the Ingress, Stationary positions and great conjunctions and oppositions of the planets should receive attention.  These two examples are pointing the way on how to combine the two fields (astrology and astronomy).

pg. 20

From page 50 of "The Stars":
Listed is a few of the 50-odd stars influencing New York and the stock exchange fluctuations.

An aspect of longitude occurs at a specific Time and in a specific Season (of the year).  This is described in the BLH lecture.

pg. 21.

Use the 15-degree increments between the separation of two planets (synodic to synodic), and test these with the yearly season as a filter parameter.

pg. 22

Orb: "There is no orb."
Reference to Jensen's ACSM page 38, and to Jayne about declination.

Use a certain orb, then narrow it down via declination.  

Those that have not solved orb yet, should use about 10 minutes of longitudinal arc on either side of exact.

Include planets Transpluto and Chiron in our research.

pg. 23.

Aspects are unique to each market.

pg. 24

ACSM, page 82: 
Keep in mind specific angular relationships of Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus are the key to stock in the bullish or bearish directions.  Each commodity has its own combination of one or two of the foregoing, PLUS either Mercury, Venus or Mars.

After the inner planets (are tested), test declination (transiting to transiting) between planets.  Use parallels and contra-parallels.

In NYSE stock General Motors, parallels and contra-parallels of transiting Geocentric Mercury and Sun produces turns at about 83%, with a turn allowance of 1 day.


pg. 27

The business cycle is correlated with the sunspot cycle and seasons of a year.  It is connected with weather. 

Gann has on his reading list:
"Sunspots and Weather" by W.T. Foster.  It shows how to forecast sunspots.

pg. 29
You have to combine sunspot cycle with planetary confgiurations.  

In "Law of Values" by Sepharial, on pages 16 and 17, states that countries are tied to certain signs of the zodiac.  An example is the United States and Gemini.  Thus transiting Saturn through Gemini will depress the value of securities in the US. Always be cognizant of planets in the signs, in relation to the country whose securities you are trading in or holding.

pg. 30
Testing the Golden Key to this field.  It is what will get you ahead.

Test for only a single element at a time.  Many individuals put too many factors into a test, which invalidates that test.

Pages 30-36 has instructions on how to do testing.

pg. 37-58
Information about locality-based astrology.  
How to calculate geographic Asc and MC.


pg. 59
Solar arcs: A symbolic method where all radix points are progressed by the yearly addition of the motion fo the Sun, i.e. the motion of the Sun during one day = movement of all radix points after 1 year (a day for a year principle).  Radical relations are maintained.

pg. 60

Figure 1 shows directed solar arc after 15 years. 

Also from Sepharial's Arcana:
Prime Significator (PS): Planet that rules the sign in which the sun is found (in radix, solar arc, transit?)
Secondary Significator (SS): Planet that rules the decanate of the Prime Significator.

pg. 61

Lunar arcs: General monthly influences are obtained from "Minor directions" (i.e. lunar arc), which is based on the motion of the moon.  According to Robson. 

Declination arcs: A three dimensional technique developed by Jayne and Heseltine.  Declination is measured from the celestial equator, i.e. It is an Earth based system. 

Transit-solar arc: This is a system where aspects between actual transiting points and arc-ed points are considered.  

Sepharial says to use the mean motion of the Sun (59'08" per year).  This is called the mean rate of progression.  Valentine Naibod originally advocated this system in 16th century.  There is also the apparent rate of progression.  

To work with solar and lunar arcs, you need:
  - Extensive database (greater than 100 years of market data)
  - Correct natal.
  - Proper software / ephemeris.

Conclusions of this seminar paper:
  - Important to understand the differences between personal and
    financial astrology.
  - Due to contradictions in literature, extensive testing is required.
  - Important to choose right progression rate for the sun and for the moon.
  - Using correct natal and enough data is the basis to start working with 
      solar and lunar arcs 

pg. 62

Workplan for researching solar and lunar arcs is given.  

Hypothesis list for testing is given.

pg. 63

Methods to reduce noise:
Instead of using a fixed orb, you can study orb and use it for evaluating the system according to the following simple model:

  - Turn date
  - Astro event
  - Astro date
  - Calculated orb

If you follow this setup, you may later sort for what you want to study, for example you can study all the events with an orb < x days and you can study each type of event separately.  

Inactivity or activity can then be based upon orb; you can calculate mean orb for a specific event.  You will start to see patterns you couldn't see before; "Noise can be reduced.  

pg. 64

Shows how to test for declination arcs.  

pg. 65

Conclusions:
  - Test everything.  Eliminating a factor is also a positive result.
  - If you do not reduce the number of testing parameters, you may not
    see the correct solution.
  - Working with calculated orbs allows you to see new patterns.

Natals charts of the following are discussed:

  - Bank of England chart
  - Jensen's United States chart
  - Rectified United States chart [by authors of "12", with reasons]
  - Jensen's Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT) chart 
  - Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) chart
  - New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) chart
  - American Express (AXP) chart
  - 3M (MMM) chart
  - The Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company (GT) chart

pg. 76-79

Process used to rectify the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) is shown.  The final natal arrived at is given also.

pg. 81-85

Process used to rectify EBAY is shown.  The final natal arrived at is given also.

pg. 84

The process of "scanning" is described on this page.  "Scanning" is the process used to find the exact natal time of a stock after one has the sensitive zodiac points on the 15-degree axis.  The process is done by slowly incrementing the natal time-of-day by an amount to move the ascendant a certain amount of longitude distance so that it hits the next increment of a sensitive point on the 15-degree axis.  Then it is checked to see if the MC or Vertex line up also with the other sensitive zodiac points on the 15-degree axis.

When two points are locked in, there is a very high probability that the true natal has been found.  

pg. 86

Shortcut technique is given for converting a floating point number of degrees to degrees and minutes.  Take the floating point portion, divide by 10 and multiply by 6.  Example:  For 0.75, divide by 10 to get 0.075, then multiply by 6 to get 0.45, which stands for 45 minutes.  

Using decimal format for the planetary longitude location makes it easier to do excel formulas and math on the numbers.  For example, to convert from longitude degrees (out of 360) to the 15 degree axis is just a mod 15 operation.  

pg. 86-89

On these pages, the rectification of the natal chart of NYSE is covered.  The final natal arrived at is given also.  The solar arc of major events on the exchange, such as the 1987 crash day is used to verify.  Uranus in 1987, via solar arc, opposed the ascendant of the rectified chart.

pg. 89-90

Rectification of the natal chart for Amazon (AMZN) is covered.  The final natal arrived at is given also.  

pg. 90-91

Secret tips for finding the founding date quickly:

If one is seaching for the founding data for the Solaris Company:

1) Go to a search engine and type one of the following:

  Solaris + founded on
  Solaris + founded on + date

Usually you will have to go through a few pages.  

2) Sometimes you can get lucky and find the founding date on the company's website.  Just go to the site and see if they have any of the following:

  Corporate information
  History
  Timeline

3) Sometimes the year that it was founded is the only thing that the company lists and we need both the location and the date.  Say for example, they list 1967 as "the founding", then use that and go back to the search engine and type:

  Solaris + date + 1967

In some cases we have not found a thing as far as a date and location so we move onto the next stock or commodity.  

4) If the above techniques have failed and you are determined to get the information.  There is another technique but it takes more tie.  Go to the company's website and get their phone number.  Call them and ask them on what date they were founded.  Buy a couple of books.  Go to the library and research it, etc.

5) The website: www.answers.com has a TON of founding dates.  Go there and type in the company name and then click on answers.  Then scroll down for the information.  

pg. 91

Putting the rectification technique into a defined process:
1) Go to a stock and take 12 of its' largest turns.  This book has done that for stocks that have been around for 50 years or more.  It is best to avoid turns like the market crash of 1987 and other long-term market dates, and instead focus in on unique turns.  In summary: Try to use turns that are unique to the stock or commodity when doing rectification.

pg. 100-108
Rectification of the natal chart of Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) is on these pages.  

Two different techniques were used to rectify the MSFT natal.  One was the long method (using 65 turns), using the traditional way.  The other was the short method, using '12' turns and expanding the number of turns if required.  

The long method:
The long method analyzed the planet positions (Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune, Pluto, Chiron and Transpluto), putting each planet location into buckets.  The buckets are for locating the important points on the 15-degree axis, and thus all the buckets together span the range of [0, 15) degrees.  The bucket sizes are 10 minutes of arc each.  After all planet locations on each of the turns are put into the buckets, the highest sum of three consecutive buckets are located.  This gives us the approximate important 15-degree axis points.  

The short method:
Gather 12 sharp, clear turns, as large as possible.  Write down the planetary positions on the dates of those turns for Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune, Pluto, Chiron and Transpluto.  From the 12 turns, you should be able to account for at least 50% of the 12 turns using a minimum of 4 hits to an axis.  If this is not the case either do 1 of 2 things.  Either go back and grab more turns from teh same data, or abandon this stock or commodity and move on to another, which will be more fruitful.  From those axis test the 'founding data' as well as the incorporation date or other focus by scanning the times to coincide with the axis.  

Important concepts and tips scattered among the natal rectification pages:

pg. 94
"When we do not feel confident about our [15-degree axis] points, as is with the case with Proctor and Gamble (PG) above, we scrap that project and go back through using smaller turns."

pg. 95
Look at the turns with the longitude position listing of the 7 planets:
  - Jupiter
  - Saturn
  - Uranus
  - Neptune
  - Pluto
  - TransPluto
  - Chiron

pg. 95
With the process of looking at 12 turns, we would want to have two 15-degree axis points with at least 5 hits a piece.  

pg. 96-67
Sometimes discerning exactly which bar is the top can be a pain.  Each top/bottom should be studied to try to understand exactly where the turn occurred.  There are some tricks we use such as if you are looking for a top, look closely at the highest close.  Sometimes a stock will have the exact high or low 2 days in a row.  If this is the case, we use the second day.  It is best in the beginning to deal only with very sharp turns; later, once experience takes hold, deal with turns that are a little trickier.  Never use a roving top or bottom. 

Regarding rectification: In America since 2000 through 2005, the stock market has been sideways and choppy.  While this activity has put most traders to sleep, it makes finding highs and lows easier as the turns are more pronounced due to the lack of trend.  Therefore it makes stocks with less history easier than in a trending market.  

pg. 99
"You will find that some stocks/commodities are easier to rectify than others.  Likewise you will find that some stocks/commodities are more profitable than others."

pg. 108
"Be cognizant that there were some stocks Gann could not make money in and some that he could, the same rules apply to you."
