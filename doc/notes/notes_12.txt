# Notes on the book "12" by Gregory M. Carpenter (and other WITS members)
##############################################################################

pg. 3.
Respected authors: Gann, Bayer, and Jensen.

pg. 4.
Allan Blakstad: "There is a lot happening at Highs and Lows."

There is information on time cycles in the WITS group and in TTTA, but you won't find them in this (12) book.

It takes faith in yourself (i.e. faith in your abilities), and persistence, to succeed.

pg. 5.
Price is found via the use of time cycles; this is why you need the cycles before you forecast price.

You must know the cycles before you can use the (Gann) squares.

pg. 6.
Your real goal: Understand the cycles in Gann's book: TTTA.

You have to get those cycles; cycles lead you to success.

pg. 7.
This work will teach you how to identify the transiting planets that are affecting your market.  You will learn how to rectify any natal quickly and efficiently.  You will observe how the correct natal produced turns and how you can develop a system for profits on an intermediate level.  You will see in no uncertain terms, the cause of the business cycle and factors that enhance it.  You will learn the factors that are impacting you, creating success or failure depending on your location on the globe.

pg. 11.
Pyramid of the trading field:
  Numbers
  Squares
  Time Factors and Cycles
  Natals
  Aspects and Eclipses.


Gann's TTTA covers the top 5.
Bayer covers Squares, Time Factors, and Natals.
Jensen covers Aspects, Eclipses, Natals and Time Cycles in his writings.
R.T.A. covers aspects and natals.

The squares operate off of Time Cycles, and Number is "shorthand" for these cycles.  Therefore the key is to focus on Time Factors and Cycles.  Information for this is in TTTA by Gann and "Time Factors" by Bayer.  There are also many posts on WITS.

Time Cycles have the problem of not being exact.  This is where the natal comes in handy; it allows you pin the orb down to the exact day or two.  

pg. 12.
Previously they said: To solve orb, look at Jupiter and Saturn 45's.
While you can do it that way, there is a much better way and that is to have a "fixed point" and one planet.  That way you are working with one variable and not two. Active points in a natal count as a fixed point.  

For example:
If the actual point is Saturn transiting over 13 deg 52, but the market turns 13 deg 44, 13 deg 42, and 13 deg 46, thus the market is 'firing' early.  So we createa  'swath' (range) of when the turn will happen.  Saturn transverses these points in one day!

Fusing this principle with Time Cycles is the "Golden Key".

pg. 13
Every stock or commodity responds to ITS OWN aspects.  An aspect between Uranus and Jupiter may turn one market but not another.  So for any market you trade in, you should identify which aspects affect (turn) that market.  You simply go through the aspects one at a time to find which ones work.

List of 'required reading' books:
1) A to Z horoscope Maker Delineator (Llewellyn George)
2) Astro Cycles & Speculative Markets  (Luther Jensen)
3) The Tunnel Thru The Air (W. D. Gann)
4) Kabala of Numbers (Sepharial)
5) Power of Number (Numero)
6) Periodicity (Jos. Buchanan)
7) Key to Bible and Heaven (Ludwig Larson)

pg. 14
Gann used both Helio and Geo.

TTTA: 
Regarding the war in the air:  Look at the dates of battles in the book and compare that to what was occuring in the Dow Jones at that time. 

This book is all about cycles, many different types of cycles and understanding this will save you time.

The way to succeed is to master TTTA.

pg. 15
Regarding software: Solar Fire if you can afford it.
Avoid paying big money for software.  All you need is a cheap ephemeris.

Chiron rules Taurus.
Transpluto rules Virgo.

Always use True Node (and not Mean Node).  

pg. 16.
Use aspect sizes of 15 degree increments.  
(i.e. Increments of 1/24th of a circle).

pg. 19
Books by Johndro to study after learning Astrology and Astronomy:
1) Earth in the Heavens
2) Fixed Stars

It is in these two books that astrology and astronomy come together. 

There is a critical error in Johndro's book "Earth in the Heavens".  He later recanted one aspect of the book.  The Midheaves of the locality charts are FIXED; they are not precessional.  "The actual zodiac used in interpretation is right in step with the equinoctial precession and always has been.  Therefore each country and city has the exact same rulership as it always has."  

From page 51 of "Earth in the Heavens":
"To the dates of eclipses, planetary stationaries, great conjunctions and oppositions, new moons and events."

From page 53 of "The Stars":
Eclipse configurations are the principle indicators of the great events of the year, through the Ingress, Stationary positions and great conjunctions and oppositions of the planets should receive attention.  These two examples are pointing the way on how to combine the two fields (astrology and astronomy).

pg. 20

From page 50 of "The Stars":
Listed is a few of the 50-odd stars influencing New York and the stock exchange fluctuations.

An aspect of longitude occurs at a specific Time and in a specific Season (of the year).  This is described in the BLH lecture.

pg. 21.

Use the 15-degree increments between the separation of two planets (synodic to synodic), and test these with the yearly season as a filter parameter.

pg. 22

Orb: "There is no orb."
Reference to Jensen's ACSM page 38, and to Jayne about declination.

Use a certain orb, then narrow it down via declination.  

Those that have not solved orb yet, should use about 10 minutes of longitudinal arc on either side of exact.

Include planets Transpluto and Chiron in our research.

pg. 23.

Aspects are unique to each market.

pg. 24

ACSM, page 82: 
Keep in mind specific angular relationships of Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus are the key to stock in the bullish or bearish directions.  Each commodity has its own combination of one or two of the foregoing, PLUS either Mercury, Venus or Mars.

After the inner planets (are tested), test declination (transiting to transiting) between planets.  Use parallels and contra-parallels.

In NYSE stock General Motors, parallels and contra-parallels of transiting Geocentric Mercury and Sun produces turns at about 83%, with a turn allowance of 1 day.


pg. 27

The business cycle is correlated with the sunspot cycle and seasons of a year.  It is connected with weather. 

Gann has on his reading list:
"Sunspots and Weather" by W.T. Foster.  It shows how to forecast sunspots.

pg. 29
You have to combine sunspot cycle with planetary confgiurations.  

In "Law of Values" by Sepharial, on pages 16 and 17, states that countries are tied to certain signs of the zodiac.  An example is the United States and Gemini.  Thus transiting Saturn through Gemini will depress the value of securities in the US. Always be cognizant of planets in the signs, in relation to the country whose securities you are trading in or holding.

pg. 30
Testing the Golden Key to this field.  It is what will get you ahead.

Test for only a single element at a time.  Many individuals put too many factors into a test, which invalidates that test.

Pages 30-36 has instructions on how to do testing.

pg. 37-58
Information about locality-based astrology.  
How to calculate geographic Asc and MC.


pg. 59
Solar arcs: A symbolic method where all radix points are progressed by the yearly addition of the motion fo the Sun, i.e. the motion of the Sun during one day = movement of all radix points after 1 year (a day for a year principle).  Radical relations are maintained.

pg. 60

Figure 1 shows directed solar arc after 15 years. 

Also from Sepharial's Arcana:
Prime Significator (PS): Planet that rules the sign in which the sun is found (in radix, solar arc, transit?)
Secondary Significator (SS): Planet that rules the decanate of the Prime Significator.

pg. 61

Lunar arcs: General monthly influences are obtained from "Minor directions" (i.e. lunar arc), which is based on the motion of the moon.  According to Robson. 

Declination arcs: A three dimensional technique developed by Jayne and Heseltine.  Declination is measured from the celestial equator, i.e. It is an Earth based system. 

Transit-solar arc: This is a system where aspects between actual transiting points and arc-ed points are considered.  

Sepharial says to use the mean motion of the Sun (59'08" per year).  This is called the mean rate of progression.  Valentine Naibod originally advocated this system in 16th century.  There is also the apparent rate of progression.  

To work with solar and lunar arcs, you need:
  - Extensive database (greater than 100 years of market data)
  - Correct natal.
  - Proper software / ephemeris.

Conclusions of this seminar paper:
  - Important to understand the differences between personal and
    financial astrology.
  - Due to contradictions in literature, extensive testing is required.
  - Important to choose right progression rate for the sun and for the moon.
  - Using correct natal and enough data is the basis to start working with 
      solar and lunar arcs 

pg. 62

Workplan for researching solar and lunar arcs is given.  

Hypothesis list for testing is given.

pg. 63

Methods to reduce noise:
Instead of using a fixed orb, you can study orb and use it for evaluating the system according to the following simple model:

  - Turn date
  - Astro event
  - Astro date
  - Calculated orb

If you follow this setup, you may later sort for what you want to study, for example you can study all the events with an orb < x days and you can study each type of event separately.  

Inactivity or activity can then be based upon orb; you can calculate mean orb for a specific event.  You will start to see patterns you couldn't see before; "Noise can be reduced.  

pg. 64

Shows how to test for declination arcs.  

pg. 65

Conclusions:
  - Test everything.  Eliminating a factor is also a positive result.
  - If you do not reduce the number of testing parameters, you may not
    see the correct solution.
  - Working with calculated orbs allows you to see new patterns.

Natals charts of the following are discussed:

  - Bank of England chart
  - Jensen's United States chart
  - Rectified United States chart [by authors of "12", with reasons]
  - Jensen's Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT) chart 
  - Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) chart
  - New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) chart
  - American Express (AXP) chart
  - 3M (MMM) chart
  - The Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company (GT) chart

pg. 76-79

Process used to rectify the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) is shown.  The final natal arrived at is given also.

pg. 81-85

Process used to rectify EBAY is shown.  The final natal arrived at is given also.

pg. 84

The process of "scanning" is described on this page.  "Scanning" is the process used to find the exact natal time of a stock after one has the sensitive zodiac points on the 15-degree axis.  The process is done by slowly incrementing the natal time-of-day by an amount to move the ascendant a certain amount of longitude distance so that it hits the next increment of a sensitive point on the 15-degree axis.  Then it is checked to see if the MC or Vertex line up also with the other sensitive zodiac points on the 15-degree axis.

When two points are locked in, there is a very high probability that the true natal has been found.  

pg. 86

Shortcut technique is given for converting a floating point number of degrees to degrees and minutes.  Take the floating point portion, divide by 10 and multiply by 6.  Example:  For 0.75, divide by 10 to get 0.075, then multiply by 6 to get 0.45, which stands for 45 minutes.  

Using decimal format for the planetary longitude location makes it easier to do excel formulas and math on the numbers.  For example, to convert from longitude degrees (out of 360) to the 15 degree axis is just a mod 15 operation.  

pg. 86-89

On these pages, the rectification of the natal chart of NYSE is covered.  The final natal arrived at is given also.  The solar arc of major events on the exchange, such as the 1987 crash day is used to verify.  Uranus in 1987, via solar arc, opposed the ascendant of the rectified chart.

pg. 89-90

Rectification of the natal chart for Amazon (AMZN) is covered.  The final natal arrived at is given also.  

pg. 90-91

Secret tips for finding the founding date quickly:

If one is seaching for the founding data for the Solaris Company:

1) Go to a search engine and type one of the following:

  Solaris + founded on
  Solaris + founded on + date

Usually you will have to go through a few pages.  

2) Sometimes you can get lucky and find the founding date on the company's website.  Just go to the site and see if they have any of the following:

  Corporate information
  History
  Timeline

3) Sometimes the year that it was founded is the only thing that the company lists and we need both the location and the date.  Say for example, they list 1967 as "the founding", then use that and go back to the search engine and type:

  Solaris + date + 1967

In some cases we have not found a thing as far as a date and location so we move onto the next stock or commodity.  

4) If the above techniques have failed and you are determined to get the information.  There is another technique but it takes more tie.  Go to the company's website and get their phone number.  Call them and ask them on what date they were founded.  Buy a couple of books.  Go to the library and research it, etc.

5) The website: www.answers.com has a TON of founding dates.  Go there and type in the company name and then click on answers.  Then scroll down for the information.  

pg. 91

Putting the rectification technique into a defined process:
1) Go to a stock and take 12 of its' largest turns.  This book has done that for stocks that have been around for 50 years or more.  It is best to avoid turns like the market crash of 1987 and other long-term market dates, and instead focus in on unique turns.  In summary: Try to use turns that are unique to the stock or commodity when doing rectification.

pg. 96

The start of the rectification process for General Electric (GE).  The final natal was not given for this stock.  Enough information was given to be able to find two important points on the 15-degree axis', and thus to be able to rectify the stock.  

Of the stocks given in "12":
 About 25% are vibrating to their incorporation date.
 About 70% are vibrating to their founding date.
 About  5% are vibrating to mergers and other special activity.

Rectification of the natal chart of Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (WMT) is on these pages.

pg. 100-108
Rectification of the natal chart of Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) is on these pages.  

Two different techniques were used to rectify the MSFT natal.  One was the long method (using 65 turns), using the traditional way.  The other was the short method, using '12' turns and expanding the number of turns if required.  

The long method:
The long method analyzed the planet positions (Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune, Pluto, Chiron and Transpluto), putting each planet location into buckets.  The buckets are for locating the important points on the 15-degree axis, and thus all the buckets together span the range of [0, 15) degrees.  The bucket sizes are 10 minutes of arc each.  After all planet locations on each of the turns are put into the buckets, the highest sum of three consecutive buckets are located.  This gives us the approximate important 15-degree axis points.  

The short method:
Gather 12 sharp, clear turns, as large as possible.  Write down the planetary positions on the dates of those turns for Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune, Pluto, Chiron and Transpluto.  From the 12 turns, you should be able to account for at least 50% of the 12 turns using a minimum of 4 hits to an axis.  If this is not the case either do 1 of 2 things.  Either go back and grab more turns from teh same data, or abandon this stock or commodity and move on to another, which will be more fruitful.  From those axis test the 'founding data' as well as the incorporation date or other focus by scanning the times to coincide with the axis.  

Important concepts and tips scattered among the natal rectification pages:

pg. 94
"When we do not feel confident about our [15-degree axis] points, as is with the case with Proctor and Gamble (PG) above, we scrap that project and go back through using smaller turns."

pg. 95
Look at the turns with the longitude position listing of the 7 planets:
  - Jupiter
  - Saturn
  - Uranus
  - Neptune
  - Pluto
  - TransPluto
  - Chiron

pg. 95
With the process of looking at 12 turns, we would want to have two 15-degree axis points with at least 5 hits a piece.  

pg. 96-67
Sometimes discerning exactly which bar is the top can be a pain.  Each top/bottom should be studied to try to understand exactly where the turn occurred.  There are some tricks we use such as if you are looking for a top, look closely at the highest close.  Sometimes a stock will have the exact high or low 2 days in a row.  If this is the case, we use the second day.  It is best in the beginning to deal only with very sharp turns; later, once experience takes hold, deal with turns that are a little trickier.  Never use a roving top or bottom. 

Regarding rectification: In America since 2000 through 2005, the stock market has been sideways and choppy.  While this activity has put most traders to sleep, it makes finding highs and lows easier as the turns are more pronounced due to the lack of trend.  Therefore it makes stocks with less history easier than in a trending market.  

pg. 99
"You will find that some stocks/commodities are easier to rectify than others.  Likewise you will find that some stocks/commodities are more profitable than others."

pg. 108
"Be cognizant that there were some stocks Gann could not make money in and some that he could, the same rules apply to you."

pg. 109-110

J.H. Nelson found that:

  - Disruptions in trans-Atlantic radio signals occur when the outer planets (Jupiter outwards) are 90, 180, and 0 degrees apart Heliocentrically.

  - The triggering mechanism would be a fast planet (Mercury, Venus, and Mars) coming into aspect with the other 2 planets.  

  - Jupiter and Saturn had a more pronounced affect than the other planets.

  - When Juiter and Saturn were in an angular relation of 60 or 120 degrees, radio signals were uncharacteristically clear.  


It has been said that a stock's price is influenced in the following manner:

  - 60% Trend of entire market
  - 20% Trend of the industry of which the stock is a member.
  - 20% Individual trend.

Of the 60% that trends with the entire market, the movements are broken down into the following:

  - Major Trend (lasting years)
  - Intermediate Trend (lasting months)
  - Minor Trend (lasting days and weeks)

From Luther Jensen in American Astrology Magazine, August 1948 to January 1950:
Factors influencing Jensen's results:
August 1948: "An extremely bearish cyclical convergence (cycle) will not mark a decline unless the TECHNICAL POSITION is vulnerable" ... and vice versa.

June 1949, regarding accuracy of his forecasts: 
"The research error factor on day to day trend prospects can be high... the TECHNICAL POSITION 4 months ahead is obviously an unknown quantity."

This means he is aware his predictions may be off, and we should still listen to what he has to say.  

pg. 116

Jensen's point #1:
In all three examples, Jensen uses the "Significator" of the aspect between the outer planets.  The Significator is the fastest moving planet of the 2 in aspect. 

Examples:
For an aspect between Saturn and Uranus, Saturn is the Significator.
For an aspect between Saturn and Jupiter, Jupiter is the Significator.

An aspect between outer planets can be triggered by faster moving planets/points, i.e. the Sun, Mercury, Venus and Mars. 

pg. 120-121.

Jensen's point #2 and #3:
Saturn in bad aspect to the Moon's True North Node will cause bearish psychology.

The sign that the planets are in influences psychology thus:
  - Look at the sign that Jupiter, Saturn, and Uranus are in.  Sextile signs give a bullish psychology as due trine.  Signs that are square or opposed would give a bearish psychology.  

February 1949, Jensen writes:
"Cyclical indicators are severely potent one time and appear to operate very mildly at others.  The degree of their operation depends on the state of public psychology and the technical position of the markets involved."

September 1948: "... protend investment support in heavy industries aircrafts and steels."

These are keywords.  From page 41 of Jensen's ACSM, we find the keywords attached to the following planets:

  Steel    ==> Mars
  Aircraft ==> Uranus
  Oil      ==> Neptune

Jensen's point #4:
To get indications, (positive or negative) for a particular industry, find that industries' ruling planet, such as Neptune for oil, etc. listed on page 41 of his book.  

Then watch aspects to that planet:
  - Trines/sextiles will be beneficial to that industry.
  - Squares/oppositions will be harmful to that industry.
  - Conjunctions for good or bad are based on planets in conjunction.  
    It is best to check back for past effects.

pg. 125
Jensen's point #5:
When both a good and bad aspect are occurring at the same time, it depends on the technical position of the market as to which aspect will be more dominating.  

For investor sentiment, it is helpful to look at Investor's Business Daily's "economic optimism index" which one can find at:
http://www.pollingreport.com/consumer.htm

pg. 130
Jensen's point #6:
Watch the retrograde period of Mercury.  

pg. 132
Jensen's point #7:
The effects of bad aspects by the outer planets can be retriggered by inner planets/Sun.  Thus there would be continuing negative effect on each retrigger.

pg. 133
Jensen's point #8:
There are two factors:
  - There are aspects between the outer planets for bullish or bearish trends.
  - There is the perceived optimism/pessimism 
    (see Investor's Business Daily's "economic optimism index" which was 
    mentioned previously).

Therefore fast moves will occur when the above two are in sync.  

Bullish aspect and bullish optimism = bull move.
Bearish aspect and bearish pessimism = bear move.
Bullish aspect and bearish pessimism, or vice versa = mixed market.

pg. 135
Jensen's point #9:
The 3 factors are:
  1) Cycical Indicators (asepcts between outer planets)
  2) Public psychology; confidence, optimism and pessimism.
  3) Technical position.

pg. 136
Jensen's point #10:
Eclipses have a definite impact on financial markets.  Some eclipses are more important than others.  

pg. 139
Jensen's point #11:
Ingresses affect the minor trend.  


pg. 139-141

It is known that Jensen has scattered elements throughout all of his writings.  The first step is to acquire these writings.  The next step is to cross reference for similar material in order to build a case (for a rule).

Jensen, January 1950:
"We known that a cyclical wave of about 4.5 years marks the general trend from highs to lows and from lows to highs.  In recent years this is apparent from 1932 to 1937, the decline from 1937 to 1942 and the rise from 1942 to 1946..."

ACSM, page 78:
"There are the 41 to 43 month cycles, the 4.5 year, 9 year, 10 year, 18 year, or 3 times 18 for the 54 year affair... the real core is apparent in the cycle of the Node.  But to get back to our May 1942 Washington figure..."

ACSM, page 126:
"Often there is a search for repeating cycles by statistics and then there is the constant reference to the economic cycle.  The former is often heard of 9 year cycle, 11 year cycle, 18 year cycle, or the 54 year cycle.  Recently the low of 1976 in sun-spot activity, and the wide range effects related to weather, harvests and humans, has relegated its average 11 year cycle to prospects of an 80-90 year cycle... the latter or what is labeled the economic cycle avoids being trapped by a time factor."

Extracting from these excerpts, we have the following dates which are related to each other:

7/8/1932 (L)
3/10/1937 (H)
4/27/1942 (L)
5/29/1946 (H)

We suspect a cycle of 54, divided by 3 = 18, divided by 2 = 9, divided by 2 = 4.5.

From Sepharial's "Cosmic Symbolism", page 98:
"Another very interesting cosmically cycle is that of the eclipse period.  The initial value of this is 18 years 11 days 7 hours 42 minutes and 35 seconds, being the mean interval between an eclipse and its reoccurrence.  In three cycles, the eclipse has moved through one sign of the zodiac, and in 12 x 3 or 36 cycles, it will have moved through the entire zodiac and come to its original occurrence.   Then 18 x 3 x 12 = 648 years, to which we add 1 for the precesssional increment and obtain 649 years as the eclipse cycle, after which the phenomena occurs in teh same part of the zodiac."

Jensen, May 1949:
"During the past 15 months, the commodity price index has reversed to a downward trend and confirmed that reversal.  Comparable conditions have occurred in 1815, 1865 and in 1920.  After each of these zones comparable to the 19471948 commodity price reversal because they follow years of excessive war demand and inflation, the major trends held downward for 13 to 15 years: half a Saturn cycle.  The decline from 1815 made a low in 1830, 1865 peak to low in 1879 and the 1920 peak a low in 1933. "

What he states is during war, commodity prices get pushed up and inflated.  Then after the war peak, there is a downward cycle of 13 to 15 years, which is half of a Saturn cycle of 29 years. 

This is not the only place in his writings where he mentions 15 years.  Let's take a look at material that is private and extremely rare:

Jensen writes:
"In the tracing of planetary interaction an adequate key is apparent.  Incidentally, there is sufficient evidence to show that Sun-spot activity is caused directly by the planetary interaction and therefore is na indicator secondary to planetary positions.  For general purposes, the changing relationships within a 360-degree spectrum, of Jupiter, Saturn and uranus reflect cyclical timing indicators of economic ebb and flow.  The half circle or 180-degree, reflects interruptions in the time factors appearing as interruptions in teh primary or major trend of the business index.  Because of differing speeds around the 360-degree spectrum by Saturn, Uranus, and Jupiter, they are in conjunct at varying intervals -- Jupiter and Saturn every twenty years, etc.

When the number of luncations (new Moons are added to the varying peaks of 180 degree, 90 degree, 60 degree, 45 degree and 30 degree angular relationships, between the constantly varying positions of these major planets in relation to the earth, timing elements become relatively precise.  For 180 lunations is just short of fifteen years, and 90 lunations is about seven and a half years.

For example, the beginning of another major downward cycle is assumed in stock market prices from the fall of 1929.  Being downward the 90, 45, 22.5, etc. lesser cycles apply -- upward major cycles are marked by 60, 30, 15, etc. time units.  In tracing the trend since, we find that 90 months elapsed from teh 1929 top to the 1937 high.  Major lows to major highs hold in the same adequate average: The summer of 1929 to early 1933 and from early 1933 to 1937, etc."

pg. 143

Jensen's point #12:
In a triangle technical pattern, watch for the breakout at [or near] the apex.

pg. 144

For the last 100+ years, the major recessions have been tied to Jupiter-Saturn conjunctions and oppositions.  Years ending in 0 or 1 have felt the full force of this.  Get some long-term data and go back through history to prove this to yourself.

Quick-and-dirty "12" method is used to find the active transiting-to-transiting important 15-degree axis points.  The method is used on an example using dates from Gann's October Egg courses.  

pg. 147-158

Systemization:
After having the important points on the 15-degree axis, one would want to re-analyze the turn dates we originally compiled and check the planet longitude data on an individual planetary level.  The first first step in this is to determine which planets were more prominent when they hit the axis.  

Example used was on Walmart.  The 2 axis were:
4 deg 12
11 deg 54

Starting with the Jupiter column, modulus 15 operation was done.  Then the values were observed to see which fell on the axis (using roughly 10 minutes of orb either side of exact).

The data shows there was 1 hit to the 11 deg 54 axis and 3 hits to the 4 deg 12 axis.  Let's start with the 4 deg 12 axis.

Our next step is to test a bach to see what type of results are obtained, over a period of time, when Jupiter hits the 4 deg 12 axis.  [List of dates for this criteria are listed from 1990 to 2005].

Next we need to check what occurred on these dates in our Walmart stock price.  [List of dates follows with a column indicating if there was a High, Low, or nn (not noticable)].

Summary: Out of 41 possible, 22 produced significant turns or 53.6%.

Jupiter hit the 11 deg 54 axis on the following dates. [List of dates for this criteria are listed from 1990 to 2005].

Again, we need to check what occurred on these dates in our Walmart stock price.  [List of dates follows with a column indicating if there was a High, Low, or nn (not noticable)].

Summary: Out of 56 possible, 24 produced turns, or a rate of 24.8%

We need to go through the other outer planets in the same manner.  In doing so, we get the following: [table with results are shown, see page 154].

Now most individuals that have made it this far woudl probably give up, but we want to purpose that we continue.  Let's have a look at our worst one.  That would be 16 hits by Pluto to the 4 deg 12 axis, of which only 4 produced notable turns.  The 4 dates that did produce turns need to be pulled aside and studied.  We want to see what other hits to the same axis were occurring at these times.  

1/12/1979:  Mercury and Venus were at 4 deg 12, 
            Neptune and Pluto were at 19 deg 12.
1/30/1979:  Mercury was at 4 deg 12, 
            Pluto was at 19 deg 12.
12/26/1996: Sun was at 4 deg 12,
            Pluto was at 4 deg 12
10/25/1997: Venus and Mars were at 19 deg 12,
            Pluto was at 4 deg 12, 
            Node was at 19 deg 01

Using this idea of simultaneous hits to the same axis, we can begin to investigate different combinations.  

The following chart shows the combination of all the outer planets from Jan 2001 to Dec 2003, hits to 11 deg 54 axis.  Notice that there is an 'alignment' in 2 places. [pricebar chart is shown on page 155].

On top of that, we added in Sun and Venus hits to the 11 deg 54 axis, these were chosen at random.  [pricebar chart is shown on page 156].

Now from that we used Venus as the trigger and looked at hits by the outer others (Sun and outers) within 1 day.  This produced the following.  [pricebar chart is shown on page 157].  Out of the dates, only 3 were not tradable turns.  [list of dates tradable and not tradable is given on page 158.]
