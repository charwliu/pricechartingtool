Notes on the book: "Ask and It Is Given" by Esther and Jerry Hicks
##############################################################################

pg. xxiii

Question: How can we more effectively achieve our goals?
Answer channeled being Theo:   Meditation and affirmations.

pg. xxiv

Question: What do you mean by meditation?
Answer channeled being Theo:   Sit in a quiet room.  Wear comfortable clothing, and focus on your breathing.  As your mind wanders, and it will, release the thought and focus upon your breathing.  It would be good for you to do it together.  It will be more powerful.  

Question: Could you give us an affirmation that would be valuable to use?
Answer channeled being Theo:   "I, [say your name], see and draw to me, through divine love, those Beings who seek enlightenment through my process.  The sharing will elevate us both now."

pg. xxvi

Abraham is not a singular consciousness as you feel that you are in your singular bodies.  Abraham is a Collective Consciousness.  There is a Non-Physical Stream of Consciousness, and as one of you asks a question, there are many, many oints of consciousness that are funneling through what feels to be the one perspective (because there is, in this case, one human, Esther, who is interpreting or articulating it) so it appears singular to you.  We are multidimensional and multifaceted and certainly multi-consciousness.

pg. xxix

It's not Abraham's work to decide what we should want, but it IS their work to assist us in achieving whatever we desire.  In Abraham's words: Abraham is not about guiding anyone toward or away from anything.  We want you to make all your decisions about your desires.  Our only desire for you is that you descover the way to ACHIEVE your desires.  

pg. 3

Abraham speaks from the Non-Physical dimension.  Of course, you must understand that you also have come forth from the Non-Physical dimension.  The physical world has come forth from the projection of the Non-Physical.  In fact, you and your physical world are extensions of the Non-Physical Source Energy.  

In this Non-Physical realm, we do not use words, for we do not require language.  We communicate perfectly with one another; our Non-Physical language is one of vibration, and our Non-Physical communities, or families, are those of intention.  In other words, we radiate that which we are, vibrationally, and others of like intent assemble.  This is also true of your physical world, although most of you have forgotten that this is so.  

Abraham is a family of Non-Physical Beings naturally assembled by our powerful intention to remind you, our physical extensions, of the Laws of the Universe that govern all things.  It is Abraham's intention to help you remember that you are extensions of the Source Energy; that you are blessed, loved Beings; and that you have come forth into this physical time-space-reality to joyously create.  

pg. 4

It is our desire that you be pleased with where you are right now, in this moment -- no matter where you are.  It is our absolute promise to you that when you understand the power of feeling good now, no matter what, you will hold the key to the achievement of any state of being, any state of health, any state of wealth, or any state of anything that you desire.  

pg. 5

Your life is not ony about experience and knowledge, but it is also about fulfillment, satisfaction, and joy.  Your life is about the continuing expression of who you truly are.

All your power is in your 'now'.
Emotional Guidance System.
Vibrational set-point.

This book covers a series of processes that will assist you in reconnecting with the Non-Physical part of yourself, processes that will help you in achieving anything you desire.  

pg. 8

When you have achieved everything on your current list of things that you desire, there will be another list, even longer and more expansive to take its place.  
This book will assist you in returning you to:
- Your place of optimism
- Positive expectation
- Expanding joy

Remind you that there is nothing that you cannot be, do, or have.  

pg. 9

We came forth from the Source Energy, and 

Remember the joyous, powerful nature that is you, knowing that you would always remember the splendor of the Source from which you came, and knowing you could never lose your connection to that Source Energy.  

pg. 11

You are creator of your own reality.  

Have determination to guide your own life. 

pg. 12

By adapting to your society's attempts to make you fit in, and in your own attempt to find less trouble, you have unwittingly relinquished your most basic foundation: Your total and absolute freedom to create.  

You have not given up this freedom easily, however, and in fact, you can never truly release it, for it exists as the most basic tenet of your very being.  Still, in your attempt o release it for the sake of getting along, or in your hopeless resignation that you have no other choice than to give up your powerful right to choose, you have gone crossways to your natural current, and contrary to your very soul.


No one else can create in your own experience.

This book is about realignment with the Source Energy.
It teaches about realigning with external forces and Universal Laws.

pg. 13

You are eternal beings in physical form.

pg. 14

Well-Being is the basis of this Universe.  Well-Being is the basis of All-That-Is.  It flows to you and through you.  You only have to allow it.  Like the air you breathe, you only have to open, relax, and draw it into your Being.  

This book is about consciously allowing your natural connections to the Stream of Well-Being.

pg. 15

The reason you have not already gotten what you desire is because you are holding yourself in a vibrational holding pattern that does not match the vibration of your desire.  

So now, the only thing you need to do is gently and gradually, piece by piece, release your resistant thoughts, which are the only disallowing factors involved.

pg. 16

Well-Being flows; Well-Being wants you!  Well-Being is lined up outside your door.  Everything you have ever desired, whether spoken or unspoken, has been transmitted by you vibrationally.  It has been heard and understood by Source and has been answered, and now you are going to FEEL your way into allowing yourself to receive it, one feeling at a time.

You are a physical extension of Source Energy.  
You and that which you call Source are the same.
You cannot be separated from Soruce.
Source is never separated from you.
When we think of you, we think of Source.
When we think of Source, we think of you.
Source never offers a thought that causes separation from you.


pg. 17
Source is always fully available to you.

From the Non-Physical, you created you; and now from the physical, you continue to create.  

pg. 18

When you are consciously aware of your own thoughts, and you are deliberately offering them, then you are the deliberate creator of your own reality.  

Desire is the beginning of all attraction.

As that 'asking' never ends; the 'answering' never ceases to flow.  And so, new perspectives will always be yours.  


pg. 18, 19

One you relax into the idea that you never cease to be, that new desires will be constantly born within you, that Source will never stop answering your desires, and that your expansion is, therefore eternal, then you may begin to relax if, in this moment, there is something that you desire that has not come yet to fruition.  

It is our desire that you become one who is happy with that which you are and with that which you have -- while at the same time being eager for more.  That is the optimal creative vantage point: To stand on the brink of what is coming, feeling eager, optimistic anticipation -- with no feeling of impatience, doubt, or unworthiness hindering the receiving of it -- that is the Science of Deliberate Creation at its best.

pg. 21

There is a current that runs through everything.  It exists throughout the Universe, and it exists throughout All-That-Is.  It is the basis of the Universe, and it is the basis of your physical world.  [rluu: This may be the same as prana.]

As you begin to understand the basis of your world, and you begin to look for, or better said, FEEL FOR, your awareness of this source Energy that is the basis of all things, you will then understand everything about your own experience.  You will also more clearly understand the experiences of those around you.

pg. 22
You can feel whether you are allowing your full connection to the Soruce Energy or not.  In other words, the better you feel, the more you are allowing your connection; the worse you feel, the less you are allowing your connection.  

You are a Vibrational Being in a vibrational environment.  

pg. 23

Your emotions can be used as vibrational interpreters. 

pg. 25

Every thought vibrates.
Every thought radiates a signal.
Every thought attracts a matching signal back.

Law of Attraction: That which is like unto itself is drawn.

You must find ways of holding yourself consistently in vibrational harmony with those desires in order to receive their manifestation. 

pg. 26

Whatever you are giving your attention to causes you to emit a vibration, and the vibrations that you offer equal your asking, which equals your point of attraction.  If there is something you desire that you currently do not have, you need only to put your attention upon it, and, by the Law of Attraction, it will come to you, for as you think about this thing or experience that you desire, you offer a vibration, and then, by Law, that very thing or experience must come to you.  

However if there is something that you desire that you currently do not have, and you put your attention upon your current state of not having it, then Law of Attraction will continue to match that not-having-it vibration, so you will continue to not have that which you desire.  

The key to bringing something into your experience that you desire is to achieve vibrational harmony with what you desire.  The easiest way for you to achieve vibrational harmony with it is to imagine having it, pretend that it is already in your experience.  Flow your thoughts toward the enjoyment of the experience, and as you practice those thoughts and begin to consistently offer that vibration, you will then be in a place of allowing that into your experience.  

By paying attention to the way you feel, you can easily know if you are giving your attention to your desire or if you are giving it to the absence of your desire.  

pg. 27

You get what you think about, whether you want it or not.  

Worrying is using your imagination to create something you do not want. 

pg. 28

Difference in vibrational thinking:
Appreciation of something, versus, what you would like different.

pg. 29

Your desires and your beliefs must be a vibrational match in order for you to receive that which you desire.  

pg. 31

Rediscover the "Art of Allowing" the Well-Being.

pg. 33

Leading Edge of Thought.

A powerful Stream of Source Energy is now stretched out before you from which your individual, personal preferences will be received.  In other words, because of what so many have lived and are living, and because of the summoning power of so many of their desires, the Well-Being of your future experience is well in place.  And, in like manner, your current desires will, in turn, provide an Energy stream for future generations to benefit from.

pg. 34

The Stream of Well-Being flows even if you do not understand that it does, but when you consciously become aligned with it, your creative endeavors become so much more satisfying, for then you discover that there is absolutey nothing that youd desire that you cannot achieve.  

pg. 35

Without asking, you will receive no answer.  Asking is a form of summoning.  

pg. 36

See yourself, right where you are now, as the beneficiary of the powerful Stream of Well-Being.  Try to imagine that you are basking in the flow of this powerful stream.  Make an effort to feel yourself as the Leading-Edge beneficiary of this unlimited stream, and smile and try to accept that you are worthy of it.  

You (and how you feel) is all that is responsible for whether you let in your inheritance of Well-Being or not.  And while those around you may influence you, more or less, to allow or not allow that Stream, it is ultimately all up to you.  

pg. 39

You are a vibrational transmitter, and you are broadcasting your signal in every moment of your existence.  

pg. 40

Your world, present and future, is directly and specifically affected by the signal that you are now transmitting.  The personality that is You is really an eternal personality, but who you are right now, and what you are thinking right now, is causing a focusing of Energy that is very powerful.  This Energy that you are focusing is the same Energy that creates worlds.  And it is, in this very moment, creating your world.  

You have a built-in, easy-to-understand guidance system within you, with indicators that help you understand the strength or power of your signal, as well as the direction of your focus.  This guidance system helps you understand the alignment of your chosen thought with the Energy Stream itself.  

Your feelings are the representatives of your guidance system.  In other words, the way you feel is your true indicator of your alignment with your Source, and of your alignment with your own intentions -- both pre-birth and currently.  

pg. 40, 41

Your powerful beliefs were once gentle thoughts.  The only way to consciously deactive a thought is to activate another.  In other words, the only way to deliberately withdraw your attention from one thought is to give your attention to another.  

When you give your attention to anything, the vibration, at first, is not very strong, but if you continue to think about it, or speak about it, the vibration gets stronger.  So, with enough attention to any subject, it can become a dominant thought.  As you give more and more attention to any thought, and as you focus upon it and therefore practice the vibration of it -- the thought becomes an even bigger part of your vibration -- and you could now call this practiced thought a belief.  This thought that has now evolved into a belief will always be played out in your experience.  

pg. 41

The longer you think thoughts, the stronger they become.  

Harmony    with the Source ==> good feelings.
Disharmony with the Source ==> bad  feelings.

Your focus and attention to it invites it in.

Every thought that you give your attention to expands and becomes a bigger part of your vibrational mix.  

Since this is an attraction-based Universe, there is no such thing as exclusion.  Everything is about inclusion.  

pg. 43

Emotional reactions is a important sense.

pg. 44

Emotions are indicators of your point of attraction.  

Combine these to have full control over your point of attraction:
- Vibrational offering (thoughts).
- Emotional Guidance System.

Emotions are simply, purely, and only about our relationship with your Source.  

Emotions are indicators of your alignment with Source Energy.  


pg. 45

You are empowered Beings; you are utterly free to create.

Use emotion to feel your way back to Well-Being.

Harmony    (alignment)    feelings: Joy, love, sense of freedom, etc.
Disharmony (misalignment) feelings: Depression, fear, feelings of bondage.

In the same way that sculptors mold clay into the creation that pleases them, you create by molding Energy.  You mold it through your power of focus -- by thinking about things, remembering things, and imagining things.  You focus the Energy when you speak, when you write, when you listen, when you are silent, when you remember, and when you imagine -- you focus it through the projection of thought.  

Like the sculptors who, with time and pracctice, learn to mold the clay into the precise desired creation, you can learn to mold the Energy that creates worlds through the focus of your own mind.  And, like the sculptors who, with their hands, feel their way as they recreate their vision, you will use your emotions to feel your way to Well-Being. 

pg. 47

The Creative Process:
1) (your work)     You ask.
2) (not your work) The answer is given.
3) (your work)     The answer, which has been given, must be received or allowed (you have to let it in).  "Art of Allowing".  Your vibrations must be in a match to let it in. [pg. 48].  The way you FEEL indicates your level of allowing or resisting.  [pg. 51].


pg. 48

Your "asking" is sometimes spoken with your words, but more often it emanates from you vibrationally as a constant stream of personally honed preferences, each building on the next, and each one respected and answered.  

pg. 49

The Creative Process is occurring whether you are consciously aware of it or not.  

Focus on what is wanted, not what is not wanted.
Your attention must be on it, not the lack of it.

pg. 51

The way you FEEL indicates your level of allowing or resisting.  

Although there is no source of sickness, you may offer thoughts that disallow the natural flow of your wellness, just as you may offer thoughts that disallow the natural flowof your abundance, although there is no source of poverty.  

It does not matter where you currently stand in relationship to anything you desire.  By paying attention to the way you feel, and by directing your thoughts to better-feeling thoughts, you can again achieve vibrational harmony with the Well-Being that is natural to you.

Vibrational harmony:
When you appreciate something, you are a vibrational match to who you really are.
When you love someone, or yourself, you are a vibrational match to who you really are.


Vibrational disharmony:
When you find fault with yourself or another, you are, in that moment, offering a vibration that does not match who you really are, and the negative emotion you feel is your indicator that you have introduced a vibration of resistance and that you are no longer in the state of allowing your pure connection between the physical you and the Non-Physical part of you.

pg. 51, 52

The Non-Physical part of you is your "Inner Being" or your "Source".  It is not important what you call that Source of Energy, or Life Force, but it IS important that you are consciously aware of when you are allowing a full connection to it and when you are restricting it in some way.  Your emotions are your constant indicators of your degree of allowing or resisting that connection.  

pg. 53

With practice you will be able to achieve a focused control of this Creative Energy, and become a joyous, deliberate creator.  

When focusing Creative Energy, there are two factors to consider:
1) Intensity and speed of the Energy.
This has to do with the amount of time you have spent considering your desire.  Your summoning power is much greater when you have spent a larger amount of time considering your desire.  After considering the desire for some time, you will have experienced contrast that helps you to become even more specific about it; and your desire summons it in an even more powerful way.  Thus the desire has gained power or speed.
2) Your level of allowing or resisting it.  
This step you can utilize how you feel to know your level of allowing or resisting.


pg. 54

It is not about controlling thoughts.  It is about guiding thoughts.

Reach for the way you would like to feel.  

Reaching for the way you would like to feel is an easier way to hold your thoughts in vibrational alignment with that which you believe is good.

pg. 54, 55

Whenever you give your attention to a thought, those other thoughts that are in vibrational harmony with that original thought also rise and join the activated thought, making it a more pronounced, more powerful and more attractive thought.

pg. 55

Before you can effectively benefit from paying attention to your emotions, you must first accept that Well-Being is the only Stream that flows.  You can allow or disallow this Stream, but when you allow it, you are well, when you disallow it, you are sick.  There is only a stream of wellness.  

pg. 56

A "belief" is only a practiced vibration.  And so, as you have life experience that matches those thoughts you were pondering, you conclude, "Yes, this is truth."  And while it may be accurate to call it "truth", we would prefer to call it attraction, or creation.  

Anything that you give your attention to will become your "truth".  The Law of Attraction says that it must.  Your life, and everyone else's too, is but a reflection of the predominance of your thoughts.  These is no exception to this.  

pg. 57
You are radio transmitters and receivers.  You live in a Vibrational Universe, and you are more Energy, Vibration, or Electricity than you realize.  

pg. 60

People sometimes try to control conditions when they disapprove of them.  They try to do this through personal force or strength, or gathering in groups to feel more power or control, but in doing so achieve vibrational alignment with unwanted things. And as more unwanted things manifest in their experience, they shore up their own belief (they "prove it" to themselves) that they were were right all along about how bad and invasive that unwanted thing was to begin with.  In other words, the more you defend your own beliefs, the more the Law of Attraction helps you live them out.  


About Truth:

With enough attention to anything, the essence of what you have been giving thought to will eventually become a physical manifestation.  And then as others observe your physical manifestation, through their attention to it, they help it to expand.  And then, in time, this manifestation, whether it is one that is wanted or not, is called "Truth".

There are many wonderful things that you are making your Truths, and there are many not-so-wonderful things that you are making your Truths.  Deliberate Creation is about deliberately choosing those experiences you make your Truths.  

pg. 62

When you continue to focus upon any thought, it becomes increasingly easy to continue to focus upon it because the Law of Attraction is making more thoughts like it available to you.  And so, emotionally speaking, you are developing a mood or an attitude.  Vibrationally speaking, you are achieving a habitual vibrational groove, so to speak -- or a "set-point".


Moods as indicators of emotional set-points.

pg. 63

Your emotional set-points can be changed.  In other words, your habitual vibrational groove, in response to certain events, can be set to whatever your desire.  There is extreme value in deliberately achieving your own set-points.  Because, once you expect something, it will come.  The details may play out differently, but the vibrational essence will always be an exact match.


pg. 65

You are a physical extension of Source Energy.
An eternal Stream of Source Energy flow to you and through you -- and it IS you.
This Stream of Source Energy flowed before your physical Being, and will continue to flow after what you call "death".

Emotions let you know how much Source Energy is flowing.  

They also let you know whether your preponderance of thought on the subject matches your desire, or matches the absence of your desire.  

For example: 
A feeling of passion or enthusiasm indicates that there is a very strong desire focused in the moment; a feeling of rage or revenge also indicates that there is a very strong desire. 

A feeling of lethargy or boredom indicates very little focused desire in the moment.  

pg. 66

When you really want something, and you are thinking about your desire and feeling pleasure from the thought, your thought vibration is now in alignment with your desire -- and the current from your Source is flowing through you toward your intended desire with no restriction or resistance.  We call that "allowing".  

But when you really want something and are feeling anger or fear or disappointment, that means you are focused upon the opposite of your desire, and in doing so, you are introducing another non-matching vibration to the mix.  The degree of negative emotion that you experience indicates the degree of your resistance to your receiving of your desire.  

Your emotions are absolute indicators of your vibrational content.  

It is our encouragement that you pay attention to how you feel and allow your emotions to be the valuable indicators they are. 

If your emotions are helping you know that your choice of thoughts is not taking you in the direction that you desire to go, then do something about that:

Replenish your connection by choosing better-feeling thoughts.  

pg. 68

It is not a difficult thing to change the pattern of your vibration, especially when you understand that you can do it a little bit at a time.  

pg. 69

When you desire something that you do not believe is possible, you are not in alignment.

When there is something that you want and you are feeling unhappy that you do not have it, you are not in alignment.  

When you are jealous that someone has something that you want, you are not in alignment.  

We should consciously feel our way into alignment.  

pg. 70

All of your desires, wants, or preferences emanage from you naturally and constantly, for you stand at the Leading Edge of a Universe that makes that so.  So, you cannot hold your desires back; the eternal nature of this Universe insists that your desire come forth.  

This is the simple basis of this eternally expanding Universe:
- Variety causes contemplation.
- Contemplation produces preference.
- Preference is asking.
- Asking is always answered.

Pay attention to the way you feel, and deliberately choose thoughts -- about everything -- that feel good to you when you think of them.  

rluu: I should make a list of things that make me feel good.  I should keep that list with me, and read it often.  Also have a nature picture I like to look at.  And music I like.  

pg. 71

You will learn to literally FEEL your way to the things that you desire, on all subjects.  


pg. 75

Once you understand the clarity that your emotions provide, you will never again not know what you are doing with your current thought.  You will always be aware of whether you are, in this moment, moving toward or away from your intended goal or desire.  Your awareness of the way you feel will give you the clarity you have been seeking -- and you will never be lost in the desert again.  Once you have the knowledge that you are moving in the direction of your desires, you may begin to relax a bit and enjoy the fantastic journey.  

pg. 79

- You are a physical extension of Source Energy.

- The physical world you live in provides a perfect environment in
  which to create.

- The variety that exists helps you focus on your own personal desires
  or preferences.

- When a desire is focused within you, the summoning of Creative Life
  Force immediately begins to flow toward your desire -- and the
  Universe expands.  And that is good.

- Your conscious realization of the Creative Process is not necessary
  in order for it to continue.

- The Leading-Edge environment that you are physically focused in will
  continue to stimulate new desires in all who participate.

- Every desire or preference, no matter how large or small it may seem
  to you, is understood and answered by All-That-Is.

- As every desire from every perceiver is answered, the Universe expands.

- As the Universe expands, variety expands.  And thus there is a loop
  of expansion: 

    - Variety in experience and vantage point.  
      (Set of contrasting circumstances).
      Thus the vibrational characteristics of you have shifted somewhat.  

    - Preferences/desires.
      (These rocket out from you).

    - Answer to desires.

    - Expansion. (Joy). 
      [rluu: Interestingly, Jupiter is associated with both expansion and joy.]

- The expansion of the Universe and your personal expansion will
  always be as follows:

    - You live in an expanding Universe.
    - You live in an expanding physical world.
    - You are an expanding Being.
    - This Universe is eternally expanding, and so are you.  And that is good.

[rluu: It is almost like we are a baby planet or baby star, and constructing it, acummulating energy and mass.  It is similar to cells/organs in the body that have their own experience, preferences, and growth.]


pg. 81

Focus activates the Law of Attraction. 

pg. 82

This is an expanding Universe, and all things must be allowed.  In other words, for you to understand and experience what you desire, you must understand that which you do not desire, for, in order to be able to choose and focus, both must be present and understood.

You did not come to fix a broken world.  You came to express yourself creatively.  

Every physical Being on your planet is your partner in co-creation, and if you would accept that and appreciate the diversity of beliefs and desires -- all of you would have more expansive, satisfying, and fulfilling experiences.  

pg. 86

Feel the balance and perfection of your environment: Every point of Consciousness, even the consciousness of a cell in your body, can request an improved state of being -- and get it.

When you stay aligned with your Energy Stream, you always win, and somebody else does not have to lose for you to win.  There is always enough.

pg. 87

An understanding of both where you are and where you want to be is essential if you are to make any deliberate decisions about your journey.

pg. 89

Your happiness does not depend on what others do, but only upon your own vibrational balance.  

The way you feel is simply, clearly, and always the indicator of the vibrational balance between your desires and your vibrational offering.

pg. 92

There is no thought that you cannot eventually have.

You cannot instantly jump to a thought that has a vibrational frequency very different from the thoughts you are usually thinking.  

Using your emotions, you can gradually and deliberately change your vibrational frequency.  

Reach for the best-feeling thought you have access to.  The key to moving up the vibrational emotional scale is to be consciously aware of, even sensitive to, the way you feel, for if you are not aware of how you feel, you cannot understand which way you are moving on that scale.  

pg. 93

A good way to feel your way up this vibrational emotional scale is to always be reaching for the feeling of relief that comes when you release a more resistant thought and replace it with a more allowing thought.  The Stream of Well-Being is always flowing through you, and the more you allow it, the better you feel.

pg. 95

Choosing different thoughts requires focus and practice.  

pg. 96

Life is always in motion, so you cannot be 'stuck'.  If you want things to change to different things, you must think different thoughts.  And that simply requires finding unfamiliar ways of approaching familiar subjects.  

pg. 99

Trying to hinder another's freedom always costs you your freedom.

pg. 100

Every 'reality' has been focused by someone into being.  

You make whatever you give your attention to, your TRUTH.  

So it is extremely beneficial for you to focus primarily on the way you feel while giving only scant attention to the manifestations (results) as they are unfolding, for whenever you are giving your primary attention to things as they are, you are hindering the expansion of what is.

pg. 101

Unwanted things cannot jump into your experience uninvited.

pg. 102

Your desire is the natural result of the contrast in which you are focused.
If you are trying to avoid your own desire, you are attempting to move contrary to Universal forces.  

Behind every desire is the desire to feel good.

And so, the standard of success in life is not the things or the money -- the standard of success is absolutely the amount of joy you feel.

pg. 103.  
You are pure, positive Energy.  You are love.  

Appreciation and self-love are the most important aspects you could ever nurture.  Appreciation of others and the appreciation of yourself are the closest vibrational matches to Source Energy of anything we have ever witnessed anywhere in this Universe.  

Whenever you are focused upon something you appreciate, since that current choice of thought is so similar to who you really are as Source Energy, there is no contradiction in your Energy.  

If you criticize someone, or even find fault with yourself, your resulting feeling would not feel good, because the vibration of this thought of criticism is so very different from that of your Source.  In other words, because you have chosen a thought that does not match who you really are, you can can, in this moment feel the discord of your choice through your emotions.  

pg. 104, 105
You must be selfish enough to align with Well-Being.

There is no need to worry that when you take, you might be taking from someone else.  The "pie" (the Universe) expands in proportion to the vibrational requests of all of you.  

The ultimate act of selfishness is to connect with Self.  And when you do that, you are pure, positive Energy focused in this physical body.


Any feelings of insecurity and hatred are bord from your disconnection with who you are.  


pg. 106

If you are feeling strong emotion, whether positive or negative, that means that your desire is powerfully focused, and you are summoning a great deal of Source Energy towards your desire.  

Feel-bad emotions: Depression, fear, anger.
Feel-good emotions: Passion, enthusiasm, expectation, love.


The perfect creative situation is to really, really want something that you truly believe is possible.


pg. 107

One must exercise the feeling of already having the desire.  

Law of Attraction says that you do not have access to thoughts and feelings that are very far from where you have recently been vibrating, but with some effort, you could find other thoughts.  Vibrational shifting is usually a gradual process.  Trying to jump vibrational ranges is a major factor in the feelings of discouragement.  

pg. 111
Your thoughts are magnetic and expand with your attention.

pg. 113
Your emotions are indicators of your vibrational frequency.  (Imagine it is like a indicator dial on your car).

Absolute alignment with your own Source Energy means that you know the following:
  - You are free.
  - You are powerful.
  - You are good.
  - You are love.
  - You have value.
  - You have purpose.
  - All is well.

pg. 115
Way to consciously move up your emotional guidance scale:
Think a thought, and then consciously evaluate whether the new thought gives you any feeling of relief from where you were before that thought.  [The crucial step is to acknowledge that your chosen thought does feel better than the thought that existed before.]  So you think and feel, and think and feel, with only one intention: to feel even the slightest bit of relief.  The slightest improvement is of great value because now you have control and are on your way to reconnecting with the Source Energy.  

pg. 116
Reach for the best-feeling thought you have access to now.  Eventually you will find yourself in a very good-feeling place.  

pg. 120, 121

If, when you are desiring, you are focusing upon being aware of its absense, then you are offering a vibration of lack.  For some, when they think of a desire, they think of not having it.  This is not true desire.  Keep in mind that whenever you ask, it is always given -- then each of your desires will now be pure non-resisted desire.  


Some think that happiness depends on releasing all desires.  That is the hard way to go about bringing yourself in alignment, because the entire Universe is poised to help you give birth to yet another new desire.  A much easier way to come into alignment with your Source is to work on releasing your resistance.  

The desire for a state of spirituality is a desire in itself.  

pg. 121. 

Imagination is the next step to manifestation.

pg. 122

When desire feels to you like it is the next logical step, then it is on the verge of manifestation.  

You can tell by the way you feel whether your vibration is in the place where you are allowing Universal Forces to deliver your desire to you now or not.  You will enjoy sensing things that are about to happen, you will enjoy seeing things beginning to fall into place, and you will adore witnessing the manifestations of your desires.

pg. 134

Make a correlation between what you have been thinking and feeling, and what is manifesting.  

pg. 135

You have no creative power within the lives of others, for they are offering their own vibrations, which equal their own point of attraction, just as you are offering your own vibrations, which equal your own point of attraction.  

pg. 136

Deliberate creation is about choosing better-feeling thoughts.  

pg. 137

Emotional Set-Point: Your pattern/habit of the way you feel about certain things.  

pg. 138

The important part is conscious change, or deliberate effort.  


The purpose of each process given is to release your resistance, and give improved feeling; to improve your Emotional Set-Point.

pg. 139 

With the given processes, the more playful you are, the less resistance you hold.

pg. 146

Often, while in the midst of a genuine feeling of appreciation for someone or something, you will feel ripples of goosebumps -- those sensations are confirming your alignment with your Source.  


Love and appreciation are really the same vibration.  These words are descriptive of Well-Being.


You cannot feel defensive while feeling appreciative.

The only thing that affects your experience is how you are flowing Energy.

pg. 147

Life is not about tomorrow, it is about right now.  Life is about how you are currently molding the Energy.

pg. 157

When you think about why you want something, you usually soften resistance, but when you think about when it will come to you, or how it will come, or who will help it to come, you often add resistance, especially if you do not already know the answers to those questions.  

pg. 195

The process for evaluating dreams:
As you go to bed, consciously acknowledge that your dreams accurately reflect your thoughts.  Say to yourself: "It is my intention to rest well and to awaken refreshed.  And if there is anything important for me to recall from my dream state, I will recall it when I wake up."

Then, as you awaken, before you get up, lie there for a few minutes and ask your if you remember anything from your dream state.  

What happened and how you FELT during your dream is important.  

pg. 210

Writing is your most powerful point of focus.  

pg. 214

In the moment that you say "I prefer" or "I like" or "I appreciate" or "I want", the heavens part of you, and the Non-Physical Enegies, in that instant, begin orchestrating the manifestation of your desire.  

pg. 218

It is easier to create an improved future experience than it is to change a current existing experience.  

pg. 219

Regarding Segment Intending:
If you take the time to get your thought of expectation started even before you are inside your new segment, you will be able to set the tone of the segment more specifically than if you walk into the segment and begin to observe it as it already is.  

You are continually projecting your expectations into your future experiences, and this Segment Intending process helps you to consciously consider what you are projecting -- and it gives you control of your future segments.

Segment Intending is not the best process to apply on something you have never enjoyed doing.  (Other processes are better suited).

pg. 221

The way you feel is actually your point of attraction.

If you want many things all at the same time, it adds confusion.  But when you only focus upon the specifics of what you want in any particular moment, you bring clarity and power to your creation -- and therefore speed.  

pg. 254

When you notice you are feeling negative emotion, stop and say, "I'm feeling some negative emotion, which means that I'm in the process of attracting what I don't want.  What is it that I DO want?"

Anytime you are feeling bad, stop and say "What I want is to feel good."

Process #8:  The Book of Positive Aspects ........................... (pg. 199)

When to use this process:
  - When positive emotion floods through you in response to a positive thought you are focusing upon, and you wish to ride the positive, good-feeling wave longer.  
  - When you are aware that a subject that requires your consistent attention does not feel good, and you want to improve your vibration on that topic. 

  - When most subjects that you focus upon feel good to you, but there are a few uncomfortable holdouts that you want to mold into a better-feeling place.  


This 'Book of Positive Aspects' will be of the most value to you when your 'Emotioanl Set-Point' is ranging somewhere between: 
(1) Joy/Knowledge/Empowerment/Freedom/Love/Appreciation
and
(10) Frustration/Irritation/Impatience
[See pg. 114 for the full spectrum range.]

  To begin the process of the 'Book of Positive Aspects', purchase a notebook that feels good when you hold it in your hands.  Choose a pleasing color, with a line width that matches your writing style, with paper that allows your favorite pen to glide along comfortably, and which opens comfortably and lies flat.  

  Because the action that will be involved in this process, not only is an improved degree of focus certain, but with the focus will come an increase in both your clarity and in your feeling of being alive.  

  Now, on the cover of your notebook write: "My Book of Positive Aspects".

  It would be beneficial to set aside at least 20 minutes for this process on your first day, but after that, you could continue in smaller increments of time.  However, you may discover the benefits of this process to be so rewarding, and the good feelings within the process so satisfying, that you may want to spend even more time at it.  

  Next, at the top of the first page of your notebook, write the name or a brief description of someone or something that you always feel good about.  It could be the name of your lovable cat, your best friend, or the person you are in love with.  It could be the name of your favorite city or restaurant.  And as you focus upon the name or title that you have written, ask yourself these questions:

    - What do I like about you?
    - Why do I love you so much?
    - What are your positive aspects?

Then, gently and easily, begin writing down the thoguhts that come to you in response to your questions.  Do not try to force these ideas, but let them flow easily through you onto your paper.  Write as long as the thoughts flow, and then read what you have written and enjoy your own words.  

  Now turn to the next page and write another name or title of someone or something that you feel good about, and then repeat the process until your 20 minutes has passed.  

  You may discover, even during the first sitting, that you will have managed to activate with yourself such a powerful vibration of appreciation and Well-Being that ideas of other names or titles for your 'Book of Positive Aspects' will continue to flow to you and when they do, take the time, if you can, to enter those titles at the top of other pages in your book.  If you feel you have the time to ask the questions "What do I like about you, why do I love you so much, and what are your positive aspects?" then do so at that time; if not, wait until tomorrow, when you will begin the process again.  

  The more positive aspects you search for, the more you are going to find; and the more positive aspects you find, the more you will search for more.  In the process, you will activate within yourself a high vibration of Well-Being (which matches who you really are).  And you will feel wonderful.  And even better: This vibration will become so practiced that it will become your dominant vibration and all aspects of your experience will now begin to reflect this higher vibration.  

  As soon as your notebook is filled, you will probably find yourself eager to purchase another and another, for there is a true power of focus in the experience of writing, and there is a true power of connecting to your own Source Energy in the experience of wirting things tha tfeel good when you write them.  

  The benefits of this process will be many: 

    - You will feel wonderful during the process.

    - Your point of attraction will continue to improve, 
      no matter how good it is now.  

    - Your relationship with each subject that you write about 
      will become richer and more satisfying.

    - The Law of Attraction will deliver even more 
      wonderful people, places, experiences, and things for you to enjoy.
