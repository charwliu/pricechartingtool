pg. 6

You see," he continued, "the year, month and day of the month of one's birth, together with one's name, give each person certain numbers, and just as those chimes form a overtone these numbers form a concord.

pg. 7

The system divides the alphabet into three divisions, or degrees. The first nine letters constitute the first degree; the next nine the second degree, and the last eight the third degree.


The significance of each number and letter of the first degree are as follows:

1: The beginning, the father.
2: The mother or moulder.
3: The created.
4: The matter, the physical.
5: The duality of man.
6: The pattern of all building.
7: The completed temple.
8: The manifestation of God
9: The revelation.

The other two degrees, with some slight differences, are simply an intensification of the first.

pg. 8

The author of the system holds that his success was due to the concord of his numbers and, to the doubting says that if they will look over their lives they will see that their periods of success have included, in each instance, the same numbers, unless it be that they have outlived the numbers under which they were born, and there is a way to determine that.

In support of her theory, the author calls attention to the old Jewish cabala,
which she asserts this system makes plain.

pg. 12

The degrees are also taken into account as each degree intensifies. Once the num- [text cuts off before end of column] addition until a digit is reached, with the exception of 11 and 22 which are not added.  

The great trinity of numbers in this system is 8, 9 and 11 and 22 is 11 in its physical form or dress. These, in a certain way, correspond to the trinity as religiously understood, and the person who has any one of these numbers will find that he is in accord with him who has in his concord either of the others.


pg. 16

According to this system, each human being is anchored in the infinite by a certain geometrical sign which reveals a digit number. Of these numbers there are but eight, 9 being a composite number, the Alpha and Omega of a cycle.

pg. 18

Mrs. Cochran spoke of what she calls the law of eleven. This, she says, is the law of equilibration. Being a fulcrum, it is either perfection or that which is opposed to perfection. There is no middle course for him who has either 11 or 22 in his numbers.

Froebel, who was a great philosopher, contended that all that is necessary is to sow the seed of good and there will be no need to combat evil.

As has been said, the author of this system says that all things are controlled by a mathematical law and that each part of the body has its own vibration. This is quite in accord with the fact that it has been found that different currents of electricity and also different light rays must be used in treating the several parts of the body.

pg. 20

The present time, according to the number cryptogram, is the dawn of the day of seven. Day signifies cycle, and the law of seven, operating universally, unifies and establishes peace, not with quiescence with present conditions, but by demanding a new code of ethics which will include all the nations of the earth.

While claiming for the Aso-Neith system of numbers the same scientific foundation as music, Mrs. Cochran makes the assertion that one who has mastered it can be consciously in two places at the same time. 

Asked to explain this, she said:

"With the eternal spirit there is no future or past, no near or far; and when in perfect harmony with that spirit it is possible to partake of its attributes. There are those who reach the fulfillment of this law at times without understanding it, just as primitive man used the laws of harmony long before those laws were sufficiently understood to lay the first foundation stone of the structure of musical expression."

pg. 21

Mrs. Cochran's cryptogram of numbers, which she calls the "Aso-Neith system," is based upon numerical science. She makes her computations by comparing figures taken from the name of the person and the date of birth with those of the musical octave and the seven primary colors, and all based upon the mystic number of the ages.

pg. 24

The Aso-Neith cryptogram deals with the hidden meaning in numbers and letters. Every letter in the alphabet has a fixed value and numbers bristle with vital significance. It is the relation existing between letters and numbers that determines the individual allotment of fame and fortune.

Renaming is simple and effective. he has only to accept it personally to enjoy the most beneficent results. That is, it is not necessary for Frederick to become illegally Robert, or Dorothy Elizabeth. It is only necessary for Frederick to think of himself as Robert, and for Dorothy to say to herself, "I am Elizabeth," and the whole current of their lives will be changed, although to their friends and to all the world besides they may be known still as Frederick and Dorothy.

There are three concords:
1, 5, and 7 are in harmony.
3, 6, and 9 are in harmony.
2, 4, and 8 are in harmony.

The three groups have differing characteristics. 

The date of one's birth gives certain musical vibrations. Now each letter has its value, and the key number is the number of the name in the aggregate.  

[rluu: Check to make sure that the method of calculation for the key number is the same as the method used by Gann.]

If the birth and the name numbers are not in harmony there is bound to be suffering in some part of the body, the character of the derangement depending upon the number that is at fault. You see, the two vibrations conflict."

pg. 25, 26

The Cryptogram is the science of choosing names whose vibratory sounds shall be in harmony with the vibrations of one's birth number.  Mrs. Cochran believes, with the authors of this Cryptogram, that the day of the month upon which a person is born exercises an all-important influence upon that person's whole life. She believes that there are certain vibratory forces set in motion by the birth date very similar in some respects to the electrical vibrations of wireless telegraphy. She also believes that each letter of a person's name sends out these vibrations, and that if the vibrations of the birth number and the vibrations of the name be not in harmony misery will result.

pg. 26
"It is an old, old science. It was known to the ancients. Mention of it is made
in the Bible. Sara's name was changed to Sarah. Joseph [sic] became Israel. Saul
was changed to Paul. And all these changes resulted beneficially to the persons
mentioned."

pg. 27

"Numbers in the birth and letters in the name," says Mrs. Cochran, "must balance each other in their sex attributes, as well as in form and color, in order to create the perfect union between a man and a woman.

pg. 28

Mrs. Cochran says this Cryptogram will teach parents how to bring out the highest and best attributes in their offsprings by giving the children the mathematically correct name and color, asserting that every number and letter has a color and musical tone peculiarly its own, and disease, which is discord is the result of discordant elements in the name. The science furnishes to its disciples signets or talismans, constructed from the geometry of the letters in the name and the birth number combined, which preserves a record of the same and is said to be a protection to the wearer.

pg. 30

There is a mathematical key to the secret of the universe, and Mrs. Cochran ahs that key.  She told the Eagle reporter that she got it out of much study of the Bible.  

pg. 31

Numbers to elements:

Fire:  2, 4, 8.
Water: 1, 5, 7.
Air:   3, 6, 9.

pg. 32

Numbers used in the equation:
  - Day number of the month of birth, summed and reduced.
      Example: March 21.  The number would be 21, and reduces to 3.  
      This 3 number is kept.
  - Numbers of the letters of the first name.
      Example: George.  756975, sums to 39, reduces to 3.
      This 3 number is kept.
  - Age of the person.  
      Example: Age of 35.  Sums and reduces to 8.
      This number 8 is kept.

These digits are to be summed up and reduced.
  3 + 3 + 8 = 14   ---->   5.

[rluu: The text then says that this person which was used as an example is a 5 number, and is part of the 1-5-7 water group, and thus their temperment is watery.]

[The text says that every 5 years he will have a change of some sort in his life which will bring him either good luck or bad luck.]

[rluu: I have a problem with this.  So for each age of the person, their number changes?  If this 5 year cycle periods are connected to the 5 that was deduced from the 3 input numbers, then how can every 5 years something happen, if one of the inputs is his age?  Or this 5 generic and not specifically applicable to George?]

pg. 34

"The Aso-Neith cryptogram is a complete science, teaching the secret meaning in numbers, letters, colors, musical tones, geometrical forms, symbols, gems, etc."

"Every letter, number, geometrical form, color and musical tone is a center of creative energy. Letters are symbols of vibratory forces in the inner soul-world. Every letter is a medium or vehicle through which subtle forces act upon the individual life.

"In the geometrical formation of letters and numbers, the angles, curves, etc., are not due to any accident, but brought about by the operation of a perfect divine plan, so as to enable the human mind to learn and properly understand all forms of truths. The Aso-Neith cryptogram teaches: The divine law of mathematical vibration of each letter of the alphabet.


"The color of each letter and number, and the relation each individual bears to the universal chromatic spectrum of being. The geometrical symbol to which every person corresponds in the universal Temple of God.

pg. 35

"Every letter, number, geometrical form, color and musical tone is a center of creative energy. Love is purely a mathematical calculation.


rluu: The rest of the work tells more about some of the life of Mrs. Cochran, how she gained a cult following, and how later she ran in trouble with people trying to debunk her, bringing her to court, her getting arrested, etc.  I decided not to take any notes on this section because it is not relevant to my goal of udnerstanding numbers.
