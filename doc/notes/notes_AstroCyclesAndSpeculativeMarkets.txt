# Notes on Luther Jensen's Astro-Cycles and Speculative Markets
##############################################################################

This document contains a continuation of hand-written notes on Jensen's ACSM.  
Notes here are on the book starting at page 35.

##############################################################################

rluu 20120515: I am skipping taking notes on the section on charting the geometric method.  I did that because that section is more 'applied' knowledge.  This is the section from pages 107-118, 124-131.  After I have the cycles worked out to a decent level of confidence, then return back to this section for further study.  I extracted the cycles mentioned from these sections.  

rluu 20120516: I wonder if the chart examples (dates) Jensen is giving related to the markets are highlighting certain cycles or time factors.  Also, the "54 years of research" and "45 years as a professional analyst" on page 131 sounds like he is hinting at numbers rather than giving information about himself.  

rluu 20120516: I read through, but did not take notes on Jensen's earthquake technique either.  This is on pages 137-142.  Probably not needed for trading and market work.

rluu 20120516: I still need to work through the time factors and numbers given by Jensen.

General information:

Planets are in constant angular relationship to one another and to the earth.  Each angle is a different facet or blend of the vibratory forces invovled and results in a different psychological motivation than another angle.  Every degree of 360 deg has its specific nature.  [pg. 35].

Primary aspects:
30, 60, 90, 120, 150, 180 on both sides of the circle.
45 and 135.
30, 60 and 120 are favorable, the 150 doubtful, the remainder unfavorable.  [pg. 35].

Briefly, two classes of angles dominate; one is the 90 deg span of 90, 45, 22.5, etc.; the other is the 120 deg group of 120, 60, 30, 15, etc.  Sometimes both occur interlocked at one time such 3 15's making a 45.  These related degrees are with inherent planet qualities, intensely important and often supersede the various complete chart figures.  [pg. 64].  [pg. 107-109].

Close grasp of the significance and operation of angular relationships are very important.  In the concluding section of this work, these angles become the foundation of the program used to define probable market trends as to prices and timing of swings and probable amplitude, using the daily, weekly, and monthly price ranges of stocks and commodities.  
  
0 degrees is always the beginning or place of origin, and the positive pole (top).  180 degrees is the negative pole (bottom).  The symbol of opposition and alternative.  All degrees which divide 90 equally are related to 'resistance'.  The 120 deg angles, and their harmonical divisons, relate to co-ordination, harmony and balance.  They are unifying and bring adjustment which relates to the ideal.  In market charts, these units mark areas of market adjustment or areas of consolidation in time and price.  [pg. 104].  

The change from one sign to another by a planet coincides with change in trend and general psychology, depending on the magnitude and speed of the planet.  Mercury changing signs is a powerful market factor, for instance, in this connection.  [pg. 36].

When an aspect appears to be stronger before exact or after exact, this is caused by the mean obliquity of the Ecliptic.  In 1936, this is 23 deg 26' 51".40; the difference between the earther's poles and the ecliptic's poles.  This obviously throws every point of the zodiac measured at the Equator, except Aries and Libra degrees, off in declination from one to four degrees.  Depending on the declination depends whether the approaching, exact, or passed aspect is most powerful.  Such a situation can delay a market turn, marked by an aspect of slow moving planets, as much as several months; and in the case of an aspect of rapidly moving planets, several days (and of course, conversely, ahead of hte ephemeral positions).  This is particularly noticable in 1935 when the important aspects involving Gemini, Cancer, and Leo practically all were strongest when approaching or ahead of time, while those involving Sagittarius and Capricorn were behind time.  This is a problem to involve careful consideration by observers.  [pg. 38].

Groups of aspects:
  Square group (generally unfavorable/bearish/activating aspects) [pg. 68] [pg. 108] [pg. 135]: 
      0  deg: Conjunction (Depends on the planet's natures)
   11.25 deg: [No aspect name given] [pg. 108]
   22.5  deg: [No aspect name given] [pg. 108]
     45  deg: Semi-square
   67.5  deg: (45 + 22.5 or 90 - 22.5) [No aspect name given] [pg. 108]
     90  deg: Square
    135  deg: Sesquiquadrate

     [rluu: For the aspects on page 108, he is basically giving the 
            11.25-degree axis values related to the diagram on page 108.]

  Trine group (generally favorable/bullish/harmonizing aspects) [pg. 68], [pg. 135]:
      0 deg: Conjunction (under certain conditions) 
                         (Depends on the planets' natures)
     30 deg: Semi-sextile
     60 deg: Sextile
    120 deg: Trine
    150 deg: Quincunx or inconjunct

  Trine group given again (different degrees) [pg. 108]:
     15 deg: [No aspect name given]
     30 deg: Semi-sextile
     45 deg: Semi-square
     60 deg: Sextile
     75 deg: [No aspect name given]
     90 deg: [No aspect name given]
     etc.
     [rluu: For the aspects on page 108, he is basically giving the 
            15-degree axis values related to the diagram on page 109.]

  Quintile group (triggering aspects) [pg. 80]:
     72 deg: Quintile
    144 deg 
    216 deg 
    288 deg

     18 deg: Circle of 360 deg has 20 divisions of 18 deg.
     36 deg: Circle of 360 deg has 10 divisions of 36 deg.
     54 deg: Circle of 360 deg has 6.66666 divisions of 54 deg.
     72 deg: Circle of 360 deg has  5 divisions of 72 deg.

   Quintile group, first series (triggering aspects) [pg. 135]:

      9 deg: The root
     18 deg: 9 * 2
     36 deg: 18 * 2
     72 deg: 36 * 2
     90 deg: 72 + 18
    144 deg: 72 * 2 (Particularly in weather and seismic data)
    162 deg: 72 + 90
    180 deg: 162 + 18

     Except for the latter [rluu: Referencing 180 deg?], this series
     [quintile group] is useful in estimating peaks of intensity
     between major planets in close aspect. [pg. 135].

   Quintile group, second series 
     (Market trend lows appear at these angles between planets) [pg. 135]:

     27 deg: 18 + 9
     54 deg: 27 * 2
    126 deg: 54 + 72
    180 deg: 126 + 54

  Parallels depend on the planets involved.  

Generally the most useful aspects are the fourths/squares, the triology/trines and the fifths/quintiles.  The squares in general are classed as bearish, unfavorable, and activating.  The trines are bullish, favorable, serene, constructive and the expansion urge.  The fifths or quintiles are generally ignore, but in mundane work covering markets and economic affairs they are very significant.  Trend reversals usually are lost in the trine and the squares, but are timed by the fifths.  Quintiles often are turning or resolving areas.  An upward market trend marked by a trine aspect situation which is waning comes to a quintile aspect (the trine changes to quintile) and the decline appears; if followed by a waxing square type of aspect, declining or bearish trends are confirmed.  The rule continues to keep it simple; in general stay with the potent aspects of the three groups and avoid trying to include every minor aspect.  [pg. 80-81].

Apparent contradiction is adjusted by noting the nature of the planets involved; a benefic such as Jupiter and Venus would have an aspect of the bullish tendencies.  [pg. 80].

Often, to keep data clarified, it is well to consider waxing and waning aspects;  As the angular relationship narrows it is waxing; as it widens it is waning.  For example, a waxing trine is labeled 120 deg, while a waning trine is labeled 240 deg.  [pg. 80].

The activity of aspects may appear confusing as the three classes actively used overlap or are in teh same degree.  Interpretation experience quickly develops the application in a specific situation.  [pg. 135].

There are specific answers to such problems of the general thumb rules failing, but it becomes rather involved with more advnace studies involving sign location of a planet and its Detriment, Exaltation, Fall, Critical degrees, and orb of aspect.  [pg. 68].

A general rule is an orb of 5% each side of center, (e.g. For 90 deg 4.5 deg, etc.).  The opposition (180 deg) is 9 deg each side of center, and the conjunction is the same.  All orbs in the quintile series are limited to 2 deg.  [pg. 135].

Expecting a precise market action, such a peak at the day and hour an aspect becomes exat may often fail.  Often the reason is that an orb of aspect should be allowed, about 2 to 5% usually is general, PLUS a trigger.  A trigger is a fast moving planet coming into the major aspect, particularly Mars, sometimes Mercury.  Hindsight will discover it on study, from which experience will develop so that advnace interpretation can take place.  No two situations are ever alike.  [pg. 68].

Sometimes indications are observed which seem to indicate an important change in local weather and nothing occurs.  The forces might be compared to a loaded gun which has all the elements to produce a shooting bullet.  Nothing happens without trigger action.  Note carefully trigger aspects conjunct or close aspects from the quintile group to the angle house cusps, exact degrees of the preceding lunation, and occasionally the parallel shift from North to South and South to North of Mercury, Venus and Mars.  [pg. 134].

Generally ignored biquintile group [rluu: Did Jensen mean 'quintile' here?] are the action triggering group, second only to the conjunctions to the 1st, 4th, 7th, and 10th house cusps (Asc., Nadir, Desc., and M.C.) [for weather in a locality chart]. [pg. 133].  Procedure to examine the business prospect of a specific area follows much the same methods we have applied to weather estimatess.  Major difference is that house positions become more significant and the angles (1st, 4th, 7th, 10th) recede from dominance.  [pg. 136].


Examples of intermediate trends [pg. 121].: 
  - 1932 to 1937, Upward trend.
  - 1937 to 1942, Downward trend.

An intermediate trend usually has 5 phases, three in its direction and two corrective minor trends.  The typical structure of it is [pg. 121]:

1) Small initial upward phase.            (Example: Jul. 1932 to Sep. 1932)
2) Minor downard trend of varying length. (Example: Sep. 1932 to Feb. 1933)
3) Second upswing minor trend.            (Example: Mar. 1933 to Jul. 1933)
4) Second setback.                        (Example: Jul. 1933 to end of 1934)
5) Third upswing and blow-off phase.      (Example: End of 1934 to early 1937)

It is almost axiomatic that the third phase of an intermediate uptrend is the largest and longest because by that time people feel the future profit prospects are both unlimited and assured.  [pg. 121].  [rluu: I think the end (highs) of the intermediate trends are related to the 120 degree aspect.  Some degree measurements to think about: 18 * 5 = 90, 24 * 5 = 120.].

General business conditions and markets:

In estimating business and market trends, the primary or major swings are involved in the Great Mutation of 240 years portent.  Set a Solar Return figure based on this radix each year.  For day-today indications, use the diurnal method already discussed.  The radix and the diurnals are set for the capital of the country in question.  A synthesis of the relationships by aspect and sign positions of Jupiter, Saturn and Uranus, plus the Sun Spot cycle is the framework upon which to project the primary trends of business and markets.  [pg. 35-36].

An 'Over' simplified method of astro-cycle interpretation [pg. 65-67].  This covers examples of usage of the 3 major planets (Jupiter, Saturn, and Uranus), planet ingresses, Moon's node, Pluto, and the Jupiter-Saturn link.  The Jupiter-Saturn conjunction is the 20-year cycle.  For more than 100 years of business and investment market statistics, beginning in 1812, the booms and depressions were geared to the angular relation of Jupiter and Saturn.  [pg. 65-67].

In the 1930's and 1940's, the usual pattern (of Jupiter and Saturn, as presented by James Mars Langham) started to break up, due to Uranus aspects becoming potent.  The Some of the phenomena of the Uranus 84 year cycle was detailed in Section I.  Also important is the cycle data of the Moon's North Node.  North American continental point of 7-9 deg Gemini is important for intensifying or cushioning the interaction patterns of Jupiter, Saturn and Uranus.  [pg. 68].

From aspects between the Moon's Node and the 7-9 deg Gemini point to form sextiles, squares, trines, etc., the major market trend takes form.  The squares approximate major lows.  This happened in 1961, 1970, and 1979.  For study, it is suggested, beginning with the square following the sextile in 1932, process each year of the stock market with the Moon's Node aspects in order to grasp the method yourself.  [pg. 69].  Jensen notes that there is a difference between the approaching square and the separating square to that 7-9 deg Gemini point.  [pg. 71].

Another element in our chain of factors is the probable effects of Pluto.  Jensen says for many reasons (not given in ACSM) that it may rule Aries.  [pg. 69].

Make sure to study the transit chart at Washington D.C. and notes on page 76.
Node is in Virgo, square 9 deg Gemini.
Saturn and Uranus are conjunct at 0 deg Gemini.  (sign ingress).
New moon (Moon conj. Sun) at 24 deg Taurus, which is sextile to Jupiter at 24 deg Gemini.
rluu: What is meant by Jupiter nearing 26 deg from Saturn?  [pg. 76].
Jensen says after this low, there is nothing to stop the uptrend until 1946. [pg. 78].

Adverse or negative aspects between Jupiter, Saturn and Uranus depress, in one form or another, business activity and markets.  A conjunction involving Saturn is notably severe.  Such an event occurred when Jupiter was conjunct Saturn early in 1941 and then the saturn Uranus conjunction in 1942.  Relief from these depressing factors began to wane (angle relationships widened) as soon as the conjunction became completed.  Late in May 1942, Jupiter was approaching 26 deg away from Saturn, a bullish index, with little of bearish importance until 90 deg difference between Jupiter and Saturn appears.  It occurs May 5th, 1946, whcih approximates the high in markets since 1942.  From early 1946, factors were sustaining but not bullish until 1949, etc. [pg. 78].

Jensen mentions static cycle lengths that the mainstream cyclists find that is really connected to the cycle of the Moon's North Node [pg. 78]:
  41-43 month cycle
  4.5 year
  9 year
  10 year
  18 year
  54 year (3 * 18 year)

Next, we would proceed and get into Ingress and Lunation charts, the part of Parallels and the details fo interpretive method.  [pg. 78].

General process of the 'Over-Simplified' method.  [pg. 78].
1) First, scan the ephemeris positions for the period involved to note the interaction of Uranus, Saturn, Jupiter and the Node.  
2) Then we trasnlate the positions into sign-house and house-sign notes.  
3) We can stop there and record when interaction occurs at critical angles of favorable and unfavorable aspects.  
4) Then a trend prospect can be concluded.  

Recap of the steps for estimating market trends [pg. 82]:
1) We become familiar with planets in their natural house-signs and then sign-houses (reference to pages 59 and 60).  
2) The zodiac is divided into 12 divisions or houses adn we become familiar with each house meaning (reference to page 39).
3) Geographical locality computing is learned (the complications of Ingresses, lunations, etc. are avoided).
4) We synthesize plaents in house locations and use sign rulership (reference to page 59) as in Horary methods for general estimates of a chart. 
5) Then natural house signs, plus sign-house interpretation are added to consideration of rulerships and the planetary powers for detailed data.  
6) Keep in mind specific angular relationships of Jupiter, Saturn and Uranus are key to stocks in the plus or minus, bullish or bearish, critical degrees noted in the text.  Each commodity has its own combination of one or two of the foregoing plus either Mercury, Venus or Mars.  

The more advanced method adds on the 'Over-Simplified' method by placing the positions in a locality chart.  [pg. 82].  In a locality chart, the house each planet is in may be significant.  And when a planet is in aspect to one or more other planets, its potency is enhanced.  So-called good or bad aspects are of little significance.  The square and the trines are significant but are of differing values according to the natures of the planets involved.  An opposition of Venus and Jupiter lacks the activation of such an aspect as Mars to Saturn, for example.  [pg. 133].  



##############################################################################

Commodtiy markets:

In commodity markets, the Moon is important in marking turns.  The time of the New Moon, or Lunation, and the Full Moon, are critical commodity points, and if a commodity makes a high or low on one key day, it will maintain its new trend until the next key day.  Ocasionally key days develop simultaneously and thereby mark extremely critical points.  Those days termed key days are when the Moon is in square aspect to either Mercury, Mars or Venus.  Another factor of importance, particularly in commodity markets, are the planetary hours of each day.  This use in hour to hour observations is of great value.  [pg. 36].

In the Jupiter-Saturn Rotational Radix (see pg. 48), the point of wheat is found by subtracting the postiion of the Sun (at the conjunction moment) from the position of the conjunction and adding the Ascendant.  This is a radix point entered and used much in the same manner as Pars Fortuna is used in a natal chart.  In the 1901 figure for London, this point feel in the second house in conjunction with the Moon at 12 deg 36' Cancer, and opposing the point of conjunction at 14 deg 0' 18" Capricorn.  This figure included the period of the War, when wheat shortages were intense.  In the 1921 conjunction (Jupiter-Saturn) at London, the point of wheat is in 10 deg 43' Leo in conjunction with Neptune and Venus.  This point of barley is found by subtracting the place of the Moon from the place of Jupiter and adding the ascendant; rye by subtracting Mercury from Saturn and adding ascendant; cotton by subtracting Mercury from Mars and adding ascendant.  These "points" are to use for supplemental purposes, however, for though they work in a unique manner, the scientific basis for them is not clear.  The basic idea was suggestd by Pallicus in an unpublished manuscript now in the British Museum.  [pg. 37].

Each commodity has its own combination of one or two of the foregoing (Jupiter, Saturn and/or Uranus) plus either Mercury, Venus or Mars.  [pg. 82].

##############################################################################

Individual stocks:

For corporation events, and the probable activity of their securities, use a radix chart the mundane house positions described in Chapter One; and the methods of Chapter Two set for the date of incorporation and located at the place of the home office.  If the exact data is known set the diurnals according to the Sidereal Time of the exact Solar Return.  If not, it is best to watch the interaction of the transits in connection with the incorporation radix set for the home office location and its radix positions and progressions, according to mundane rulership cusps.  [pg. 37].

Some success can be attained by using the diurnals based on the Solar Return of the New York Stock Exchange radix at the corporation home office location and super-imposing the corporation radix positions on the diurnals.  In the matter of markets, however, it must be stressed that technical market factors, and particularly the statistical market charts, are the yardsticks of market action.  Motivating influences are reflected by the planetary positions, but there must be a yardstick first.  [pg. 37].

Transit charts and their features/highlights:

Transit chart at Washington, D.C., for May 15th, 1942, at a major low in morale and values. [pg. 76].  Features:
  - Saturn-Uranus conjunction.
  - Node exactly square 9 deg Gemini.
  - Jupiter nearing 26 deg from Saturn.  
    [rluu: Is there any special significance to this?]

Transit locality chart at NYC, August 18, 1976.  [pg. 83].  Features:
  - Uranus square Saturn [rluu: at 6 degree orb here], 
    reflects doubts over business outlook.  
  - Saturn and Jupiter, with Jupiter now out of Gemini into Taurus,
    approach 72 deg, which is a bearish point.  Stocks are bearish.

Transit locality chart at NYC, January 15, 1956.  [pg. 87].  Features:
  - Saturn square Jupiter.  Usually very bearish, but here it is brief and Jupiter is retrograde, weakening it.  
  - Saturn/Mars trine Uranus.  This is weak too since Uranus is retrograde.
  - North Node not at a critical point.

Transit locality chart at NYC, March 6, 1962.  [pg. 88].  Features:
  - Jupiter-Saturn 18 deg.  (bearish) [rluu: on 18 deg axis].
  - Mars conjunct Jupiter opposition Uranus.  [rluu: Mars as trigger.]
    [rluu: On the chart, Jensen has Mars and Jupiter labeled with 
           the wrong degrees, but describes the correct astrological aspect.  
           Is he trying to highlight something here?]
  - Pluto square 7-9 deg Gemini point.
  - Initial downside objective late July when Node sextile 9 deg Gemini point.
  - September, "Jupiter Saturn of bullish 27 deg point".  
    [rluu: What is meant by this?  
           Note that ascendant (for NYC) is at 27 deg, and 
           for this chart, Uranus happens to be at 27 deg Leo.
           Checking the chart for September 15, 1962, 
           Jupiter is at about 6 Pisces, and Saturn at about 6 Aquarius.
           I don't see anything connected to the 27 degrees mentioned 
           between Jupiter and Saturn...].
  - New moon (Sun conj. Moon) at 150 deg to N.Node.

Transit locality chart at NYC, May 1, 1956.  [pg. 89].  Features:
  - Node opposite 9 deg Gemini point.  Market top index.
  - Neptune square Uranus: heavy distribution.  
    [rluu: On the chart, Jensen has these drawn in swapped locations.
           Is he trying to highlight something here?]
  - Nothing bullish.  
  - Look for downside confirmation at Jupiter-Saturn 72 deg point in mid July.
  - Probable low November 1957 when Node reaches 150 deg to 9 deg Gemini point,
    and Jupiter Saturn sextile confirmed.  
  - rluu: Mercury was opposite Saturn as a trigger.
  - rluu: Moon was opposite Uranus also.

Transit locality chart of NYC, November 24, 1968.  [pg. 91].  Features:
  - Jupiter near conjunct Uranus, with both opposed by Saturn.  
    Major bearish index.
    [rluu: The Saturn opposition here is pretty far off.  More like 150 deg.].

Transit locality chart at NYC, January 1, 1970.  [pg. 92].  Features:
  - September 1969 rally under Jupiter-Saturn 150 deg now exhausted with 
    bearish Jupiter-Saturn 180 deg.
  - Technical structure very weak and nothing bullish until Node 
    reaches 9 deg in late April 1970.

Transit locality chart at NYC, April 28, 1970.  [pg. 93].  Features:
  - Node at 9 Pisces, in square to Gemini 9 deg point.  Due is an important low.
  - Industrials have declined 368 points, more than 30% since late 1968.
  - Technical rebound would carry to March 24, 1971 
    for 162 deg Jupiter-Saturn with Jupiter stationary.  
    [rluu: Note that 162 deg Jupiter-Saturn is on the 18 degree axis.  
           18 degree axis was given in chart example on pg. 88].
    Such a pattern would offer a low in early November 1971 with 
    Node at 9 deg Aquarius, trine to 9 deg Gemini.
  - [rluu: In this chart, he gives the moon at 27 deg Capricorn.  
           In all the other examples, he leaves out the Moon, 
           but he decided to include it this time.  Any special reason why?]

Transit locality chart at Pgh. Pa, January 23, 1977.  Example given is for weather, but should affect business trends also.  [pg. 133].  Features:
  - Saturn in Leo.
  - Mercury and Mars in Capricorn.
  - Mercury 144 deg (biquintile) aspect to Saturn.
  - Mercury transits to sextile Uranus on the 26th.  
  - Mercury-Uranus at sensitive chart points always indicate wind and 
    when closely aspected are the key to tornado paths.  Saturn indicated cold.
  - Feb 2, Mars at 24 deg and Mercury at 18 deg triggered the Saturn
    in Leo aspected array on the MC Leo locality zone.

Transit locality chart for the depression period 1928 to 1933, of house positions for a half-dozen centers across the USA, such as YC, Detroit, Chicago, etc.  [pg. 136].  Features:
  - For quick review, note the positions of Jupiter, Saturn and Uranus only on these charts beginning in 1928.  
  - Saturn is in the MC area of Sagittarius MC charts of the West and is moving East.  Late in 1929 it is established in Capricorn moving to the square of Uranus in Aries, in a first house ruling the 12th.  
  - In 1930, Saturn clings to Capricorn in square to Uranus and Jupiter moves into Cancer squaring Uranus and opposing Saturn.  Through 1931, the situation hangs on until early in 1932 with Saturn moving East to Aquarius out of Capricorn.  
  - In 1952, there was a somewhat related situation of square and opposition, but it occurred in entirely different sectors than the 1930's in sign position and locality houses.  
  - Saturn at MC is the clue to the depression of the 1930's.

On individual charts and locality:

Incidently, if a person super-imposes a chart of birth on a selected locaity, the effects of that environment often will be indicated.  To illustrate locality factors, refer to data on the mid-1930s for the upper mid-west.  Saturn by forward and apparent retrograde was on the Ascendant opposing Neptune, Uranus afflicted also but in the second house, etc.; it was depression compounded by drought situations.  Many ultimately profited immensely but the majority suffered, particularly those with their personal chart positions related to the Saturn in Pisces locality chart.  Some years ago a person who consistently experiencd living and career problems in New York City, with an afflicted 4th house at the NYC MC in Capricorn, moved to Idaho where the Sagittarius MC was conunct his Jupiter.  In the subsequent several years he realized excellent business, health, and social success.  Of most value though is the means to adjust to the problems of a locality through an insight into area syndromes, in relation to the aspiration of the person exploring the situation.  [pg. 136-137].

On Geometry:

The foundation of the geometric method is as old as mathematics and philosophy.  The techniques are part of those ancient laws which form the foundation of modern science.  [pg. 98].

The geometrical rules presented in the text cannot be compromised at all; obey the rules without the slghtest deviation.  And adhere strictly to the market action revealed in teh graphs, not rumors.  [pg. 99].

Of all of the methods I have examined and used, the geometrical approach is the only form that enables the student to co-ordindate the fundamental laws of supply and demand, the element of time, the problem of resistance and objective and the basis of price, with the astro-economic cyclical factors.  [pg. 100].

Partners/associates of Luther Jensen [pg. 100]:
  Mr. George E. Liggett
  Mr. Virgil Moore (A.K.A "The Moon Man" in the grain markets)

Virgil Moore's phenomenal forecasts will long be remembered.  His interpretation of markets was based almost entirely on the various phases of the geometrical method of charting.  [pg. 100].  [rluu: Note the mention that there are different phases of the geometric method; this may be the same concept as covered in Gann's Ticker interview.].

It is necessary, however, so as to clarify phases of the geometrical method of charting, to refer to some of the fundamental data.  Practically all modern 'discoveries' are new applications and new variations of things which have gone before.  [pg. 101].

Examples which form much of the basis of mathematical science in modern times [pg. 102]:
  - The observations of Thales of Miletus in 600 B.C.
  - The work of Democritus in Ancient Greece
  - Leucretius in Ancient Rome

Euclid, the father of geometry, and Pythagoras, who is credited with raising mathematics to a science, presented tenets and observations which have never been refuted down through centuries of research and observation.  [pg. 102].

As Tyndall quotes them, they are the foundation of modern scientific thought.  One principle is that "Nothing happens by chance.  Every occurrence has its cause from which it follows by necessity."  [pg. 102].

Kepler's doctrine of concurrence of aprallels at a single point at infinity, and his principle of continuity in relation to the infinitely great, relates to all geometrical figures.  This thesis, as applied to natural law, was amplified by Descartes and Newton.  There is no reason why charts of market statistics, if drawn according to geometrical design, cannot be another application of these premises.  [pg. 102].

A Pythagorean proposition is that all things consist of three -- the trinity of proportions, or the:
  1) Arithmetical
  2) Geometrical
  3) Harmonical
In market terms, this is a clue to the relationship which exists between the angle of lift in charted prices; the prices, and the extent, or time of market activity in days, weeks, months, etc. [pg. 102].

Pythagoras taught futher that there is a numerical relation in all phenomena: the harmonic intervals of numbers with sounds; the pythagorean formula of a right triangle, and more importantly, that angles of a sphere have specifically corresponding numbers, which are sensitive to those angles in space, infinity and time.  The lift of charted prices does coincide with numbers at specific points in space, corresponding to price and time.  In these observations is the entire basis of geometrical charts.  [pg. 102].  [rluu: Interestingly, he says 'sphere' and not 'circle'.].

In geometrical charting, the primary rule is that there must be an identical unit to represent both time and price.  [pg. 103].

Carry charts on the daily, weekly, monthly and yearly for any interested trading entiites.  When charting days, you must chart all calendar days, including the weekends.  [pg. 105].  

Scaling [pg. 106]: 
  Grains: 1 unit of price: 1 cent
          1 unit of time:  1 day / 1 week / 1 month / 1 year
  Stocks: 1 unit of price: 1 dollar
          1 unit of time:  1 day / 1 week / 1 month / 1 year

[rluu: On pages 127 and 129, Jensen is using the same scaling for the Dow as he says to use for stocks.]

Keep the entire gamut of these critical degree points of all the groups in mind, not only when computing time by days or weeks, but in computing price and resistance.  Think in numbers rather than angles.  [pg. 108].

The points which are harmonical with the square of 90 signal resistance, and points of trend reversal, as their connecting lines extend to axial highs or lows.  In time measure, all harmonic points of 90, or from 0 to 360, represent days, weeks, or months of resistance, from a major high or low.  This coincides with the 88, 44, and 22, days cycles of Mercury.  

The points harmonical with the trines also mark important areas in time and price, but the levels they indicate are related to that type of market action that accompanies periods of adjustment or consolidation.  The trine points tie up in the approximate 365 day cycle of the Sun which markets 1 year.  

The critical points of the two groups (square and trine) operate from 0, and also from any beginning, vis, a major low at 11 would locate the 45 point at 56 (11 + 45) and not 45.

The weekly price ranges (bar chart) comprises the secret of the geometric method.  Be sure to include the week's close on the bar.  [pg. 130].

  - Jupiter-Saturn    20   years
  - Jupiter-Pluto     12.5 years     
  - Uranus-Pluto     127   years
  - Saturn-Pluto      33.5 years
  - Saturn-Neptune    36   years
  - Jupiter-Neptune   12+  years
  - Uranus-Neptune   171   years
  - Pluto-Neptune    492   years

See also, section of notes on commodity markets.  

Jensen mentions static cycle lengths that the mainstream cyclists/statistics find that is really connected to the cycle of the Moon's North Node [pg. 78]:
  - 41-43 month cycle
  - 4.5 year
  - 9 year
  - 10 year
  - 18 year
  - 54 year (3 * 18 year)

Other static cycle lengths that Jensen mentions are found by statistics, with indifferent success. [pg. 126]:
  -  9 year cycle
  - 11 year cycle (Sunspot cycle)
  - 18 year cycle
  - 54 year cycle 
  - 80-90 years major cycle (Made up of several Sunspot cycles)

Time factor: One factor sprouting another, until the "cycle" runs its course.  Its greatest problem is a trail of bad judgement.  Statistical cycles constantly skate the surface trying to average a factor from past statistical ebb and flow.  The factors become overwhelming by their large number instead of being sifted down to potent and workable simplicity.  [pg. 126].  

And markets reflect timing factors which are not precisely symmetrical as mathematical cycles, a statement which seems elementary but is noted here because a degree of elasticity has to be accepted (time orb).  [pg. 126-127].

The Earth takes 365 days to go around the Sun and the Moon makes 13 revolutions around the Earth in 364 days, or 7 revolutions in 91 days.  A satisfactory graphic presentation is to use the 360 deg circle, divide it in four 90 deg parts, and keep repeating the 90 deg square at highs and lows.  Related is the phenomenon of markets staging price surges of 11 calendar days (9 market days) which relates to the 88 day cycle of Mercury interlaced with the 365 deg and 28 deg and 91 deg factors.  [pg. 127].  
[rluu: BA says there is an error here and it is done on purpose to give us numbers.]
