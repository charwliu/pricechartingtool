pg. 16-24

Ancient Astronomers:

Philolaos
Apollonius
Aristarchus of Samos (3rd century BC)
Hipparchus (c. 130 BC)
Ptolemy (100-178 AD); he wrote the astronomical work, "Almagest".

Renaissance era:

Nicholas Copernicus (1473-1543), Polish astronomer. 
Tycho Brahe; important contributions to astronomy, but theories not correct.
Johannes Kepler; he developed the fundamental laws governing planetary motions.
John Dee, Thomas Digges, and Giordano Bruno.
Galileo Galilei (1564-1642): His telescope and discoveries completely overturned the old Earth-centered theories.
Luigi Lilio
Descartes

pg. 25-38

Modern Astronomy:

Dominique Cassini (1625-1712)
Isaac Newton (1642-1727); His discoveries extended and conslidated the 'new astronomy'.  He used Kepler's laws in his theory of gravitation.
John Harrison (1693-1776); invented the marine chronometer, the problem of time at sea and the finding of longitude was overcome.
Edmond Halley (1656-1742); found that the position of a few stars had altered over the past 1500 years, and concluded that the stars could not be fixed by moved in space relative to one another.  
Sir William Herschel (1738-1822); carried out 'surveys of the heavens'.  After many years of observation, he concluded that stars are distributed at random throughout space, but also that they form a vast galaxy, shaped like a lens or a box with the longest side aligned along the plane of the Milky Way.  
John Adams (1819-1892) and Urbain LeVerrier (1811-1877) discovered Neptune.
Calculations of Percival Lowell (1855-1916) led to the discovery of Pluto by Clyde Tombaugh in 1930.
William Huggins (1824-1910), obtained the [light] spectra of some stars, and from that, deduced the chemical compounds found in stars.
Jacobus Kapteyn (1851-1922); found that stars in our galaxy are moving en masse in two directions, one set of stars going one way and the other set moving in the opposite direction.  
Jan Oort (1900-); found that the Galaxy as a whole is rotation in a period of 225 million years.  

pg. 26

"proper motion" = The relative movement of individual stars.

In 1668, Newton built a telescope which collected its light by means of a 'parabolic' mirror instead of a lens; this type of telescope is called a 'reflector', while those which collect light with a lens are called 'refractors'.  The early refractors suffered from what is known as 'chromatic aberration'; a failure to refract all colors equally, so that the image is surrounded by a color halo.  The optician, John Dollond (1706-1761) overcame this difficulty in 1754 by constructing a lens made of two parts cemented together, called an 'achromatic'.  

pg. 28

"trigonometrical parallax": Method of measurement by which the position of a star, relative to the background of more distant stars is measured when the Earth is at opposite points in its orbit.  However, the 'parallactic shifts' of all stars are extremely small, in all cases being less than one second of arc, so that they are very difficult to measure accurately, and the parallax method can be used only for the nearest stars out to a distance of 1,000 million million miles.  

pg. 29

Physicist Gustav Kirchoff (1824-1887) and chemist Robert Bunsen (1811-1899) showed that each chemical compound and element have their own unique set of spectral lines, adn that those lines in the Sun's spectrum could tell astronomers what elements and compounds were present in teh Sun.  

pg. 30

"Doppler effect"

pg. 31

"Main Sequence": Stars that follow the 'temperature-luminosity' law are said to lie in a band called the "Main Sequence".  This is when the hotter a star is, the more luminous it is, and this is true for the majority of stars, including the Sun.  

"Blue Giants": Planets at the hot, bright end of the "Main Sequence" band.
"Red Dwarfs":  Planets at the cold, dim end of the "Main Sequence" band.

Stars which are not on the Main Sequence normally fall into one of two categories, being either "Red Giants" or "White Dwarfs".

"Hertzsprung-Russell diagram": The graph of 'luminosity against surface temperature' for stars.


"nuclear fusion" is the real source of radiation from the Sun and stars. 

pg. 33

"Nebulae" are collections of stars that look like clouds of dust and gas.

"Cepheid": a certain type of variable star (a star which periodically varies in brightness).  Each Cepheid had a period directly proportional to its brightness.


pg. 34

"red shift"

pg. 35

New branches of astronomy:
  "cosmology" (deals with the structure of the Universe as a whole)
  "cosmogony" (deals with the evolution of the Universe as a whole)

"Stead State" theory.  (an abandoned theory)
"Big Bang" theory.  (currently accepted theory)

"radio astronomy"

pg. 37

"black hole": A black hole originates from a star which has a sufficiently high mass and which, when it has reached the White Dwarf stage in its evolution, continues to collapse in on itself still further untill all of its matter has been crushed out of existence.  This process is, as yet, not properly understood.  The 'black hole' is a region of space where this collapse occurs and is not a material object.  

pg. 40

"Equator"

"Meridians of Longitude": imaginary circles running along the Earth's surface from the North to the South pole, lying everywhere excactly in a north-south direction.  At any moment in time, the Sun is on one of these meridians, and for those located at that particular meridian, it is noon.  

"Parallels of Latitude"

pg. 41

"Prime Meridian": Greenwich is adopted as the Prime Meridian for longitude.  

pg. 43

"International Date Line": The 180th meridian is designated as the International Date Line.

pg. 44

"First Point Of Aries": Spring Equinox, or Vernal Equinox [pg. 44, pg. 55, pg. 73, pg. 74]


"great circle" == any circle whose plane (level) passes through the center of the Earth.

"small circle" == any circle whose plane (level) does NOT pass through the center of the Earth.


The three main circles of reference for locating an object (celestial body) relative to any place on Earth:
1) Horizon
2) Equator
3) Ecliptic

pg. 44-45

Equatorial system:

If we project the Earth's Equator onto the imaginary Celestial Sphere, we have the Celestial Equator (immediately over the Earth's Equator), and this imaginary line or circle extending round the heavens divides it into two apparent hemispheres, the northern and southern; in the middle of each are the imaginary points known as the "Celestial Poles", immediately over and corresponding to, the North and South Poles of the Earth.


[Ecliptic system is described].

"Solstices": The points that the Sun reaches when it enters the signs Cancer and Capricorn (Summer and Winter Solstices).  When the Sun reaches either of these two points, t appears to 'stand still', and has acquiared its greatest declination.  

"Tropic of Cancer": At the time of the Summer Solstice, the Sun traces out the imaginary circle known as the Tropic of Cancer.

"Tropic of Capricorn": At the time of the Winter Solstice, the Sun traces out the imaginary circle known as the Tropic of Cancer.

These tropic lines have no reference to the heavens, but merely indicate the latitude 23 deg 27 min, where the Sun is directly overhead at maximum declination.  
pg. 46

Right Ascension (R.A.) and Declination (Dec.) uses the Equator as reference.
Latitude and Longitude uses the Ecliptic as reference.

pg. 46-54

[These pages describe the three coordinate systems in astronomy:
  - Horizon system
  - Ecliptic system
  - Equatorial system
There are many very nice diagrams on these pages for the different planes and reference points.]

[These pages deal with house division in astrology.]
[rluu: Notes were not taken for these pages.]

AC = Ascendant (1st house cusp)
DC = Descendant (7th house cusp)
IC = Imum Coeli (4th house cusp)
MC = Medium Coeli (10th house cusp.  A.K.A. Midheaven)

pg. 62

Julian Calendar ("Old Style" calendar)
Gregorian Calendar ("New Style" calendar, introduced in 1582)

pg. 63

Feast of Terminalia (end of the Roman year, on February 23).

Julian year is 365.25 days

Length of the tropical solar year is 365.24219 days, or 365 days, 5 hours, 48 minutes, 46 seconds.

pg. 64

The Babylonians, Assyrians, and Egyptians commenced their day at sunset.

The Romans commenced their day at midnight.  


Christian Easter:

The first Sunday following the 14th day of the Paschal Moon, referred to as the Paschal Full Moon.  This moon is the first moon whose 14th daycomes on or after 21 March.  If the Paschal Full Moon falls on a Sunday, then Easter is the following Sunday.  

pg. 65

Our current calendar is based on:
1) The Tropical Year (365.24219 days)
2) The Synodic Month (29.530588 days)
3) The Solar Day of 24 hours, grouped in 7-day weeks.  

pg. 65-66

Julian calendar to Gregorian calendar changes are given.

pg. 71-73

Julian Days (Julian Date) rules and calculations.

pg. 74-75

Month types:

Calendar month: January, February, March, etc.

Synodic Month: Interval between two successive "New Moons".  The average value of this month is 29.5306

Sidereal Month: The Moon's complete period of revolution relative to the stars as seen from Earth.  The mean value is 27.3217 mean solar days (27 days, 7 hours, 43 minutes, 11.5 seconds).  The number of Sidereal months in a Sidereal year is exactly one greater than the number of synodic, (365.2564 / 27.3217) = 13.3687.

Anomalistic Month: Interval required by the Moon to move in its path around the Earth from perigee to perigee is termed the anomalistic month; its value is 27.5546 mean solar days (27 days, 13 hours, 18 minutes, 37.5 seconds).

Nodical Month: The Nodical month is the interval between two successive passages of the Moon through the ascending node; its value is 27.2122 mean solar days.  Another name for this month is the "Draconic" month.

pg. 76-77

[rluu: TODO:  continue taking notes starting from this page.]

pg. 106

[Table with measurement information of the planets.  This table includes distance from Sun, periods of revolution, diameter, period of rotation, inclination of orbit to the ecliptic, eccentricity of orbit, etc.]

pg. 109-116

Information about the Moon:

Moon orbits the Earth at an average distance of 238,840 miles.

Moon's diameter is 2158 miles, just over one quarter of Earth's diameter.

Moon rises later each night because it is moving eastwards against the background of the stars at an average rate of 13 deg 12 min per day.

"Retardation" is the difference between the rising time of the Moon on one night and that on the following night.  

pg. 112-114

Information about eclipses.

The lunar shadow on the Earth's surface cannot exceed 170 miles in width.  

pg. 114

The orbital eccentricity of the Moon is 0.055, which means that its orbit is slightly elliptical, and this causes its distance from the Earth to vary between 221,000 and 253,000 miles.

The apparent diameter of the Moon varies between 33'31" (when it is nearest to the Earth at perigee) and 29'22" (when it is furthest from the Earth at apogee).

The time interval between any two quarter phases can be as short as 6 days or as great as 9 days.  

pg. 115



The Moon's axial rotation is currently equal to its Sidereal period of [about] 27 days.

This type of rotation where the rotation period of a planet or satellite is the same length as its reovlution period around the primary body, is known as 'captured' or 'synchronous rotation'.  The result is that the Moon appears to keep the same face turned toward the Earth.  However, the slight irregularities in teh Moon's motion result in variations to this rule, known as "Libration".  


Each point on the lunar surface away from the poles has approximately 15 days of daylight followed by 15 days of night.  

pg. 118

Mercury:

Mercury's maximum elongation is never more than 27 deg, and can be as small as 18 deg.

Venus: 

Venus's maximum elongation is 48 deg.


Geocentric planet states relative to the Sun:
  Inferior conjunction
  Western (morning) elongation
  Superior conjunction
  Eastern (evening) elongation

pg. 136

Bode's Law.

pg. 136-138

Kepler's Laws of Planetary Motion:

1) The planets move in ellipses with the Sun at one focus of the ellipse.

2) THe radius vector (the imaginary straight line joining each planet to the Sun) sweeps out equal areas in equal times.

3) The squares of the planets' revolution periods are directly proportional to the cubes of their distances from the Sun.

This law is known as the 'harmonic law' and defines the relationship between teh planet's orbital motion and its distance from teh Sun.  By knowing the mean distance of a planet from teh Sun, we can obtain the exact period of a planet's orbit.  

Although the third law was not complete, they enabled Newton to show that the planets behave as they do because of the universal law of gravitational attraction.  

pg. 139

Gravitation:

F = ( G * M1 * M2 ) / D

where:
F is force
M1 and M2 are masses of the two bodies
D is the distance between them
G is the gravitational constant. 

pg. 142

The Vernal Equinoctial point (0 deg tropical Aries) is that point on the Ecliptic intersected by the celestial Equator.

pg. 146

The Ecliptic is hte apparent path of the Sun, and the Ecliptic circle intersects the Celestial Equator at an angle of 23 deg 27 min.

pg. 147-149

Tides:

The gravitation pull of the Moon, and to a lesser degree, that of the Sun, causes the waters of the Earth to ebb adn flow (tides).  The moon exerts the greatest influence, particularly when, in its closest orbit to the Earth (perigee), the tides are almost 20 percent higher than when the MOon is farthest away from the Earth (apogee). 

High and Low water occur on average twice in just under 25 hours, which is the same average interval between two successive meridian passages of the Moon.  

On average, the period between two successive high tides is 12 hours 25 minutes, exactly one half the time it takes the Moon to complete the circuit about the Earth.  

As the Earht rotates, two tidal 'bulges' remain in teh same position relative to the Moon, so that they sweep around teh Earth and affect the different coastlines in turn.  The Sun's gravitation pull affects the tides too, although to a much lesser degree than does the Moon's gravitational pull.  


Spring Tides: At New Moon or Full Moon, the Sun and Moon being in line with Earth, are pulling together and this results in a high tide called Spring Tides.  

Neap Tides: At First or Last Quarter [of the Moon] the Sun and Moon are pulling at right angles to each other, adn the difference in water level between hgiha dn low tide is correspondingly much less.  

pg. 176

"First Point Of Aries": Spring Equinox, or the Vernal Equinox [pg. 44, pg. 55, pg. 73, pg. 74]

In ancient times, the Sun entered this constellation at the vernal equinox, hence the name 'First Point of Aries'.  

pg. 190-191

Information about Eclipses:

The Chaldeans were able to predict no only the time of eclipses, but also to formulate rules for judging their probable effects.  

The combined action of the Sun and Moon, studied in conjunction with the planetary positions at the time of an eclipse, indicate the importance or otherwise of a particular eclipse.  No only does the eclipse chart have to be studied overall, but it has to be related to other charts, either personal or mundane, before a true appreciation of its significance can be obtained.  

The effect of eclipses appear to manifest when the Sun, Moon, or a planet in their motion through the zodiac contact the eclipse degree.  It would seem that the eclipse chart remains dormant until it is 'galvanized into life' by a body aspecting the critical degree of the eclipse.  

The traditional teaching that the effect of an eclipse will last as many years/months as the obscuration lasted in hours/minutes, requires investigation.
