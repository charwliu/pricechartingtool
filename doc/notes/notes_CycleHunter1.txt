pg. 3

The second major item that is holding people back is actually software. The reliance on software. Buying expensive software is definitely the wrong thing to do. People who are truly succeeding with GANN are making their discoveries with little, if any, software. This has been a major issue for years. I have been in a position to observe the patterns of people succeeding against those that are not. People are genuine successes with little or no software in all cases and I mean all. The correct way to use software is to first find method, and then automate it with the software. There are “levels of success.” I am talking about the “upper levels of success.” Half -measures and systems are good for people who can use them but I am talking about that upper level of success, software is to automate a process. The exception here is charting software to “see” prices and digital ephemeris to check planetary positions.

pg. 4

TTTA is where Gann's system really is.

Your real goal is to understand the cycles working in your market.  Jensen, Gann, and Bayer all wrote about cycles.  If you do not understand the cycles in your market, then you don't have a chance.  As is explained in Turbo 2, there are different types of cycles.  The cycles work differently and some are tied together.  So your goal is cycles.  It all works off of cycles.  You must understand cycles.  Once you do, doors begin to open up and lights come on.

Gann specifically talks cycles in TTTA.  The war in the back of the book is the Dow, the "attacks by enemy" as well as the "good news" can directly be linked up with cycles.  Cycles are what you are after.  Spend you time studying cycles.  

The squares that Gann used require knowledge of the underlying cycles.  Where to anchor them?  The solution is cycles!  Certain highs and lows are caused by certain cycles.  If you cannot differentiate which high or low belongs to which cycle you will be unable to use Gann Squares in the intended fashion they are meant to be used.  The same goes for straight geometry.  The solution is cycles.  


Gann is simple, for all the mystery, once it is finally "boiled down". The average man or woman, given the proper background, should have no problems working with the simple but powerful methods.

He takes planet positions degrees of Sun, Mercury, Venus and Mars.  For Mars he writes down to the minutes.  

pg. 13

Jensen's book was really about this method [rluu: which method?], cleverly disguised.  The system is readily apparent in the charts on pages 87-93, and these were added later to show the pattern that Jensen wants you to find in his book.  After finding the pattern, you then use page 82 of his book.  If you don't have this pattern, it is difficult to trade consistently with success.

[rluu: I see 18 deg steps between Jupiter and Saturn, and the combination involved with Uranus, with a triggering planet.  Node is emphasized too.]

This pattern must be in TTTA also.

The goal is to discern a pattern out of a stock or commodity.  Isolate something repeitive that repeats with a certain amount of predictability.

Before understanding Gann squares, signs and numbers, you must find something that repeats and is predictable.  The geometry in the back of Jensen's book is not to be applied without something that repeats.  


pg. 13

Source F wrote me saying that "there are cycles in stocks and commodities and when you look at the chart of prices you are looking at the cycles". This intrigued me because I had just been working on XJO and did not realize that there were cycles running through it in this manner. He went on stating "All highs and lows are created by a cycle". I reasoned that if this was the case eventually I am going to have to isolate a cycle so I can begin to study its personality.

All highs and lows are created by a cycle.  Every turn is caused by a cycle.  

Regarding cycles: There must be a way to say "this must happen". I have made a thorough study of Ganns works and predictions, at several points he states "price must go there". 


You have to isolate a cycle so you can begin to study its personality.

pg. 14

Then the author descides to begin to start to look for cycles, comparing highs and lows in XJO.  There must be a way to find patterns.


One must test both geocentric and heliocentric planet positions.

Author comes up with a Geocentric Worksheet and a Heliocentric worksheet.

Heliocentric:
Earth
Mercury
Venus
Mars
Jupiter
Saturn
Uranus
Neptune
Pluto
Chiron

[rluu: It is every 2-planet combination for the original list of planets follows.]


Geocentric:
Sun
Mercury
Venus
Mars
Jupiter
Saturn
Uranus
Neptune
Pluto
Chiron

[rluu: It is every 2-planet combination for the original list of planets follows.]


Next, the author says to take highs and lows, and compare the DISTANCE TRAVELED of all the planets.  

pg. 18

Find 10 moves randomly that one wants to analyze for XJO:
The author chose well-defined tops.  

1) 1998-07-17 to 1998-10-15
2) 2000-07-20 to 1999-10-19
3) 2001-06-29 to 2001-09-24
4) 2003-03-13 to 2003-04-30
5) 2005-03-21 to 2005-05-17
6) 2005-10-21 to 2005-11-22
7) 2006-05-10 to 2006-06-14
8) 2006-09-25 to 2006-11-07
9) 2007-03-06 to 2007-04-18
10) 2007-08-16 to 2007-10-15

Begin with each single planet.  
Start with heliocentric first, then move on to geocentric.

Since it is XJO, an Australian stock, use Australian time.

pg. 29
Then combine the planets.  Make sure the numbers are positive for heliocentric.

[Many pages of tables of planet positions at the chosen pivot dates are given.]

pg. 71-72

I checked my email and there were several. I started with Source B. He stated that he had been experimenting with the “Factors of Location”, out of the work “12”. He had found out that if there was a planet in the 5th house of a natal and that planet squares the locality MC that individual will have a difficult go at trading in that location. Likewise if there is a planet in the 5th house and it is trine or sextile that locality MC the individual will have a much better go at trading. Furthermore look at the position of the ruler of the 5th house. Say you have Leo ruling your 5th. The Sun rules Leo, so you would look at the position of the Sun in regards to the locality MC in a square or opposition expect difficult, trine or sextile expect a much easier go. This seems to be the master indicator of long-term success in the field.


The next email was from Source F saying that he had spoken with Source G and Gann was all about cycles. There is much proof of that, from the cycles running through Ganns master courses but take a look specifically at page 197 of the Tunnel book; ”working out his cycles for stocks grain and cotton. “the page goes on then there was the day he made a discovery of a time factor. So Gann clearly used cycles.

pg. 72

This whole time factor had me confused. Do I need time factor to find cycles? I reasoned that I did not because Robert was working out his cycles when he discovers a time factor. Therefore he did not need the time factor to understand his cycles.

The next email that day was from source Q. I had written him asking about cycles and Bayer because he had made such a thorough study of Bayer. He stated that Bayer “absolutely used cycles” and that cycles run through his time factors book. He went on Adamantly declaring that the cycles were key. He stated that post 39059 was made off of cycles and that it was a very important post for the information it contained. I thought about all of this for a moment and decided that this was probably the correct path to success and I should determine more on how I was going to go about analyzing my data.

It was at this time that source F emailed me stating that the secret key to the cycles in Jensen’s book could be found on page 135 where it starts “ The triggering aspects...” He also stated that due to Jensen’s mixing up of the components of his book his explanation of orb does not apply to the type of cycles in markets that he is pointing at in his book. I wrote back a nice thank you for this extremely valuable tip. 

pg. 73

It was at this point source F told me I should not focus on an index but to try an individual stock or commodity. I decided to give the American Stock U.S. Steel a try. He also stated to keep track of my losing trades. Certain spots in a chart can give indication before hand.

He gave an example lets say you had a series of losing trades and Saturn was at 5 to 7 degrees Gemini. On another losing trade you had Mercury at 7 Gemini and on yet another trade that lost Mars was at 6 Gemini. This would give good indication to not trade when that point 5-7 degrees Gemini gets hit! Along time ago, from an old source, I learned that studying this field can be hard if the Mercury (mind) in the natal is in bad aspect to the locality MC presented in “12”. It gives a disadvantage.

Then there are the solar returns. Originally I felt that these were not that significant but now I know that to be wrong. There is a secret key; use the Return in conjunction with the numerical year governor. This is calculated thus: say you were born in 1967 in the year 2007 you will turn 40. Add this 40 to the year 2007 which gives 2047. 2+0+4+7=13 for interpretation of this 13 refer to Sepharials book “Kabala of Numbers” to tarot card 13. Another example is person born 1950 will turn 57 in 2007. Add 57 and 2007 together and you get 2064. 2+0+6+4=12. There are good and bad tarot numbers. This is a very powerful indicator when compared to the actual Solar Return for the year. The number cannot be controlled(you get what you get), to a great extent the Solar Return can be (by changing location). Being at a different location at the exact moment of the Solar Return influences that year. If you are married the spouses chart will have an affect on you as well, one way or another. That part works like this. Saturn shuts down the house (area of life) it is in. Lets say that your spouse has Saturn in the mental 3rd conjunction Solar Return Sun, this would be an indicator of depression for the year. Your spouse having depression episodes all year is going to weigh on you. If your spouse is dependent on you for income keep Saturn out of your spouses 8th house in the Solar Return. Jensen wrote on Solar Returns in the magazine “ Astrological Bulletina” from the 1930’s through mid 1950’s.

The Solar Return for the year begins 3 months before your birthday when the transiting Sun squares your natal position. From that point until your birthday is the period when the new Solar Return comes in and the old one loses its grip. Those 3 months will see big shifts and changes. Look back and you will see this is so. If you are a career individual keep Saturn out of your 10th. If you are a trader keep Saturn out of your 5th. Saturn shuts down the area of life it is in, during your Solar Return.

pg. 73-75

pg. 76

Another email comes in, Its from source B. It tells me that there is a definite connection between an individual and the stock/commodity they trade. It said to give him a call so that is what I did. He told me that if you are trading something and you are a consistent loser in it, stay away from it, no matter how much you want to trade it. He stated that there were people out there that are consistently making money and have absolutely no idea what they are doing. The secret he told me, was that they hold a good connection with that particular instrument, the ONE they can consistently make money in.

pg. 77

The minute they tried another instrument they lost money, because their connection was not adequate to that specific instrument, although they have consecutive winners on the other that they are successful in. I told source B that I found this conversation very inspiring and his reply caught me off guard. I recall, his words exactly “ when you feel worn down or frustrated it is only a sign that you have lost faith in your own abilities. Gann talks in Tunnel about the adepts of India and the sub-conscious mind. “These principles can be found in a book by Mark Fisher entitled ‘The Instant Millionaire’.

You must adapt the sayings to fit your needs, try (I do understand cycles). In doing this you will counter your feelings of frustration and burnout, your thinking will change and you will meet success quickly. Sometimes we have everything we need to succeed right in front of us but we can not see it, so success alludes us.” I quickly jotted down the name of the book and the saying realizing that the best way to become successful is to follow in the fast steps of someone who is.

Source F again e-mails me. This one is again helpful because he states that he found out from source G that orb for the type of cycles I am going to be analyzing is 20 % either side of the day count. That is if the cycle was 8 days the 8 X .20= 1.6 so 2 days either side. Then what he wrote struck me: that there is a definite solution to this so it can be overcome, but in the beginning work without it. The solution involves very little basic math and is very simple.

pg. 78

I got a response to my thank you to Source Q about “Price” it read “....in addition a commodity contracts price is difficult to the beginner because of the commodity roll overs. This is where Cash can be important until the cyclist can better understand the workings and how to handle the rollover. There is a very specific method that enables success but is hard on the beginner and not advised. A stock split is a man made occurrence, it is advised the beginner factor these out, like if it was a 2 for 1 you would multiply by 2. One final caveat, disregard the charts in Jensen’s book pages 125 and 127 until you have already mastered price. “ I decided that to follow this information as I know that source Q knows his stuff.
