Your real goal is to understand the cycles working in your makret.  Jensen, Gann, and Bayer all wrote about cycles.  If you do not understand the cycles in your market, then you don't have a chance.  As is explained in Turbo 2, there are different types of cycles.  The cycles work differently and some are tied together.  So your goal is cycles.  It all works off of cycles.  You must understand cycles.  Once you do, doors begin to open up and lights come on.

Gann specifically talks cycles in TTTA.  The war in the back of the book is the Dow, the "attacks by enemy" as well as the "good news" can directly be linked up with cycles.  Cycles are what you are after.  Spend you time studying cycles.  

The squares that Gann used require knowledge of the underlying cycles.  Where to anchor them?  The solution is cycles!  Certain highs and lows are caused by certain cycles.  If you cannot differentiate which high or low belongs to which cycle you will be unable to use Gann Squares in the intended fashion they are meant to be used.  The same goes for straight geometry.  The solution is cycles.  


Gann is simple, for all the mystery, once it is finally "boiled down". The average man or woman, given the proper background, should have no problems working with the simple but powerful methods.
