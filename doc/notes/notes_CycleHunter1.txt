The Adventures of Cycle Hunter: The Fezzan

Also known as: Cycle Hunter 1

pg. 4

Your real goal is to understand the cycles working in your makret.  Jensen, Gann, and Bayer all wrote about cycles.  If you do not understand the cycles in your market, then you don't have a chance.  As is explained in Turbo 2, there are different types of cycles.  The cycles work differently and some are tied together.  So your goal is cycles.  It all works off of cycles.  You must understand cycles.  Once you do, doors begin to open up and lights come on.

Gann specifically talks cycles in TTTA.  The war in the back of the book is the Dow, the "attacks by enemy" as well as the "good news" can directly be linked up with cycles.  Cycles are what you are after.  Spend you time studying cycles.  

The squares that Gann used require knowledge of the underlying cycles.  Where to anchor them?  The solution is cycles!  Certain highs and lows are caused by certain cycles.  If you cannot differentiate which high or low belongs to which cycle you will be unable to use Gann Squares in the intended fashion they are meant to be used.  The same goes for straight geometry.  The solution is cycles.  


Gann is simple, for all the mystery, once it is finally "boiled down". The average man or woman, given the proper background, should have no problems working with the simple but powerful methods.

Uncle Sam Steely [rluu: U.S. Steel] is a thug.

Has 4 children. [rluu: 4 different cycles?  4 different planets influencing?].

Younger two the author does not know that well.  
The older two are named Satie and Marcia.

Satie is a drunk and prefers women.

[rluu: Sounds like Saturn.]

What time was Uncle Sam Steely born?  One said 1:15 while the other stated 8:30.

[rluu: These are sensitive points on the 15 deg axis.  1 deg 15 min, 8 deg 30 min.]


Marcia was the most beautiful girl.

[rluu: Sounds like Venus.]



Marcia and Satie argue uncontrollably.
They live next door to a nun.

1994-01-09, Sunday, Low, 
1994-01-21, Friday, High, (Nun calls the police, who quieted everything down for 5 days.)
1994-01-26, Wednesday, Low,  
1994-02-10, Thursday, High, (Officer Urn makes arrests).

[rluu: What planet is Officer Urn?]

pg. 12


Time and a season (in this story's case, and/or for Saturn): 
29.5 years + 6 years = approximately 35.5 yeras.


Satie went to college for a couple of years.


Came back home mid 2005, and it was not long before fighting started with good old Marcia.  


2005-08-05, Friday, Low (Marcia's new boyfriend showed up.  His name was Enos.  This made Satie jealous, and after Enos left, things escalated.)
2005-08-12, Friday, High (two sisters got into a fight over cars, then the war ends between them two.  Then they rest for 5 days.)
2005-08-27, Saturday, Low.  (This argument between the two sisters related to something Mercurial.)
2005-09-08, Thursday, High (Nun again calls the police).

[rluu: Enos was a Bible character from Genesis that lived 905 years.]


[rluu: I've found a cycle in US Steel.  It is: G.Venus/G.Saturn: 5 degree steps.  Formula is: ((G.Venus) + 360 - (G.Saturn)) % 10, at values around 0 deg or 5 deg.  Trigger for the hits to natal needs to be added to this.]



Double-quoted words in the story are:

1995-06-16,Mercury exactly back at 9 Gemini, Venus at 6 Gemini, Sun at 24 Gemini.


1996-03-04,High,Mercury at 24 Aquarius,
1996-03-12,Low,Cycles pull price down until this date.  Then we went back up and road the line down.
1996-04-10,Low,Price road the line down until this date., Venus at 6 Gemini.

pg. 13

Jensen's book was really about this method [rluu: which method?], cleverly disguised.  The system is readily apparent in the charts on pages 87-93, and these were added later to show the pattern that Jensen wants you to find in his book.  After finding the pattern, you then use page 82 of his book.  If you don't have this pattern, it is difficultto trade consistently with success.

[rluu: I see 18 deg steps between Jupiter and Saturn, and the combination involved with Uranus, with a triggering planet.  Node is emphasized too.]

This pattern must be in TTTA also.

The goal is to discern a pattern out of a stock or commodity.  Isolate something repeitive that repeats with a certain amount of predictability.

Before understanding Gann squares, signs and numbers, you must find osmething that repeats and is predictable.  The geometry in the back of Jensen's book is not to be applied without something that repeats.  



Connected dates for XJO (Gann angle 4x1, to the downside):

1997-07-02,High,Mars at 6 Libra.  Then prices go down and come back up, riding the line down.
1997-09-02,Low,Price rides the line until this date., Mercury at 6 Virgo.
1998-09-17,High,Mercury at 21 Leo, Sun at 24 Cancer, then price goes down.
1998-09-24,High,Venus at 21 Virgo, Mars at 21 Leo.


All highs and lows are created by a cycle.

You have to isolate a cycle so you can begin to study its personality.


pg. 14

Connected dates for XJO (Gann angle 4x1, to the downside):

2002-09-06,High,Mercury at 9 Scorpio (choppy, sideways market)
2003-03-13,Low,Sun at 21 Pisces.  Author could not find any other occurances of this angle.


Connected dates for XJO (Gann angle 2x1, to the upside):

1997-04-01,Low,Mars at 21 Virgo,Price starts to move up.
1997-09-03,Low,Price comes down to test the line on this date.,Mercury at 6 Virgo.
2000-09-22,Low,Mercury at 21 Libra, then we eventually move sideways.
2001-02-04,Sideways movement until this date., Mercury at 24 Scorpio.


Then the author descides to begin to start to look for cycles, comparing highs and lows in XJO.  There must be a way to find patterns.


One must test both geocentric and heliocentric planet positions.

Heliocentric:
Earth
Mercury
Venus
Mars
Jupiter
Saturn
Uranus
Neptune
Pluto
Chiron

[rluu: It is every 2-planet combination for the original list of planets follows.]


Geocentric:
Sun
Mercury
Venus
Mars
Jupiter
Saturn
Uranus
Neptune
Pluto
Chiron

[rluu: It is every 2-planet combination for the original list of planets follows.]


Take highs and lows, and compare the distance traveled of all the planets.  

pg. 18

Find 10 moves randomly that one wants to analyze for XJO:
The author chose well-defined tops.  

1) 1998-07-17 to 1998-10-15
2) 2000-07-20 to 1999-10-19
3) 2001-06-29 to 2001-09-24
4) 2003-03-13 to 2003-04-30
5) 2005-03-21 to 2005-05-17
6) 2005-10-21 to 2005-11-22
7) 2006-05-10 to 2006-06-14
8) 2006-09-25 to 2006-11-07
9) 2007-03-06 to 2007-04-18
10) 2007-08-16 to 2007-10-15

Begin with each single planet.  
Start with heliocentric first, then move on to geocentric.

Since it is XJO, an Australian stock, use Australian time.

pg. 29
Then combine the planets.  Make sure the numbers are positive for heliocentric.
