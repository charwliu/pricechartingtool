pg. 1

Source Q says (about the charts included at the end of Cycle Hunter 1):

The secret with those charts is that they are cycles but not all of the cycle is there, only non-sequential parts. Your job is to find the cycle pivots that I have left out. Once you find the missing pivots a whole new world will open up to you. The 144 charts I sent you have the right cycles that I will guarantee. Your job is like I said to find the missing pivots. An example would be say I gave you a date of February 3 and another date of March 3. Between these two dates there will be other dates, which I skipped over. Get those dates and you will see a pattern. This is similar to the pattern in Jensen’s book. It is important to understand the patterns so you can trade, trade without guessing or relying on indicators.” 


pg. 2

Author thinking about XJO moves (from Cycle Hunter 1):

Venus geocentric moving 50 deg and 100 deg.
Mars moving 30 deg and 60 deg. 


If a cycle is correct, then the points should connect as high, low, high low, etc.


About natal astrology:

When you have a transiting planet that is making a good aspect to a planet in your natal and at the same time that transiting planet is badly aspected by another transiting planet the good affects you would have received are mitigated. An example would be your natal Venus at 6 Gemini and transiting Jupiter at 5 Aquarius (Trine). If transiting Saturn is at 5 Leo the affects of the time are mitigated, because Saturn is tainting the good affects of Jupiter via the square aspect. 
pg. 3

Author thinks about testing G. Mars moving 30 degrees.  Gives certain dates and his thinking.  

Types of people that come into the field and try to study Gann:

1) People who want to make a quick buck.  These people want fast answers, willing to put little effort.  Some of these people want proof up front. These individuals generally, when asked, will say that they are willing to put fourth all this effort, but when push comes to shove they cave, victims of their own beliefs. 

2) Then there are individuals who have a passion for the field, who hold a genuine commitment to achieve success within the field by increasing their knowledge. These individuals harbor this for years as they grow. These people will eventually meet with success, or their own form of it. It goes back to “you reap what you sow.” 


How to become successful:

What you need is the book by Mark Fisher entitled "The Instant millionaire!"

I did follow the instructions in the book, to the letter. I NEVER missed a day of my repetitive words. Those greatly aided me. Things changed quickly for me saying those words. Another area I got into was nutrient mind enhancement. That stuff is for real. I won’t go into it but you can get a book called; Ancient Wisdom of Chinese Tonic Herbs by Ron Teeguarden, that book is a secret among wealthy people. If you have ever met a truly successful individual some of them have this radiant glow; read the book and find out the secrets yourself. So no, the book did not cause me to succeed but it was an all-empowering tool. When you are frustrated in your studies, it is a sign that something is wrong”.  [pg. 5]

“Frustration simply means that you are out of balance, what you need is to back off, re-access, then find direction and move forward.”  About the effects of your house on you: “What I have learned works like this; your house is re-enforcing your misery. Change and improve the house and you will change yourself. It appears in your –mail you have a need to change also your job. Ask yourself this; if you had 4 million dollars in a bank account would you still be working there, at that job? Go ahead ask yourself that. You probably feel stuck if you answered; no I would not stay at my Job! That is where the book by Mark Fisher will come in handy. [pg. 5]

Remember, if you are miserable in your life you have only one person to blame: YOU.“  The next e-mail from B simply stated. “You will have to make changes and adjustments in your life. Most dislike change, follow the book by Fisher.” [pg. 6]


pg. 3


Gann alluded to the power of the sub conscience mind on page 264 of TTTA. 

This is why it works; deep down most of us have some out-dated belief that inhibits or limits our true success. This is generally a result of societies programming.

pg. 4

The best way to overcome this programming is by repetition of words. This works wonders but needs to be adapted to this field. The most powerful combination in my experience is that of Emily Coue (day by day in every way I am getting better and better). If this is said 100 times a day for 10 days you will observe positive changes and as time goes on, after a couple of months, you will feel depressed if you skip a few days of repeating it. There are people that will laugh at the simplicity of this, however these people are never successful i mean truly successful.


You will also have to adapt it like the following “ everyday I understand cycles better”. You say that for 2 weeks, 100 times a day and you will see a BIG difference in your cycle work. Sometimes we have all the answers right in front of us but we fail to see them because we do not truly BELIEVE that we can be successful in the field. The downward spiral here usually begins this way; we make an attempt to get something working in the markets and fail. That voice “up-stairs” usually comes in and remarks; this was a big waste of time, or this will never work, or this is impossible, after a few more repetitions of this self-destructive circle, success truly does become impossible. This needs to be countered. The best, most powerful tool to succeed against this is repetition of words, the right words”. 


In analyzing cycles, you need way more than 5 or 6 turns.  You need "a good run of data" to follow the cycle tracks.  Each stock or commodity has roughly 3 small cycles, 3 medium cycles and 3 large cycles. This is just rough; you may find a really choppy stock that has 5 small cycles or a stock that has only 1 small cycle. But 3 is the mean.

Question: If I found a cycle in a stock will it be the same cycle working in other stocks?

How are we supposed to differentiate what is MY cycle and what is not, I mean, there must be a way and here there are turns all over the damn place.  

pg. 5

There must be a way to determine if turns are part of a cycle or belong to another cycle.  

One cycle found in a stock or commodity may or may not be found in another stock or commodity.  Furthermore some cycles are strong and some are weak.  The way to determine that, the only way, is to check may pivots of the cycle.  Each cycle, being constantly impacted by the other cycles will have a turn “fizzle”. This is caused strictly by interference with other cycles. In weaker cycles there will be many “fizzles”. In stronger cycles there will be less of these “fizzles” and the cycle will therefore have sharper, more visible, turns...don’t get me wrong, the turn IS STILL THERE its just harder to detect. This is a critical element to know especially for the beginner cycle hunter.” 

pg. 7

Home oxygen levels with a home full of pets.  With low oxygen levels caused by the animals, one can expecdt sickness, lack of energy and allergy problems.  One pet won't cause problems, but a home full of pets will.

Buy organic, wholesome foods as much as possible, because the food tastes fresher and doesn't have as much chemicals added.  

pg. 8

S.A.D. == Standard American Diet.

S.A.D. is loaded with MSG.

MSG is a known excito toxin.  It causes nerve damage.  The labeling on foods has gotten trickier.  MSG is sometimes labeled as "yeast extract" or "Autolized yeast extract".  

Chinese food has MSG in it.  
In America, 95% of potato chips contain MSG.  


Flouride is a toxic poison.  It is in tap water.


pg. 9

Author personalizes the phrase he repeats every day to:
"Everyday I understand cycles better."

He said this about 100 times every day.  

pg. 13

The law of size: two large [revolution period] planets would produce a monster turn.  


Check the distance traveled in the turns, heliocentrically (2-planet combos).  Look for similar numbers.  

pg. 14

Check the distance traveled in the turns, geocentrically (2-planet combos).  Look for similar numbers.  


Information about cycles and retrograde:  

For these types of cycles the retrograde does not matter. An aspect occurs which triggers the turn one or both of the planets retrogrades, the same aspect comes back around producing yet another turn, retrograde ends, the planets move forward again hitting that same aspect producing the third and final turn.

pg. 15

This is good news for someone who is looking for cycles because it stands out and is a great way to double check to see if you have a cycle. Heliocentric does not possess this quality because it only has direct motion; a point gets hit once then the planets move on to the next point. Something for you, down the road someday, each number has its own time factor, this will make doing advanced things much easier.”

pg. 16

About "Chinese Tonic Herbs" by Ron Teeguarden:

Real medicine lies in prevention.

Drugs have this one-way effect (to affect the body), as do most herbs.  However, there is a class of herbs that have bidirectional action.  They keep the body running optimally.  

For health, like the study of financial markets, you determine your own success or failure.  You are responsible for you.  

pg. 17

Cycle hunting in the turns in XJO (from Cycle Hunter 1).  Distances of various 2-planet moves shown, and the author's thoughts.  

pg. 17, 18

What to look for when cycle hunting is a saw tooth pattern, meaning an oscillation of high, low, high, low.  This principle is very important to understand.  This adds another dimension to it, which helps in testing becuase you can look for a specific sequence instead of just a turn.  This is the fundamental key people are missing with the cycles.


pg. 18

About mundane astro:

Source B did research into T-squares and oppositions and that he had found in some writings of Jensen where Jensen stated that if there was a geocentric opposition or T-square it normally coincided with Mundane events. Like something large happening around the world. That opposition or T-square occurs in everyone’s charts. Jensen’s took it a step further and stated that how the affect of that world event would affect that individual is due to aspects in the natal. Aah, I get what he is saying, like if transiting Jupiter and transiting Saturn are making a geocentric opposition, if neither Jupiter or Saturn make any aspect to your natal planets you will be unaffected but say at the same time the opposition is occurring transiting Saturn is conjunct your ascendant, you can be negatively tied into that world event, (the event produced by the transiting Saturn/Jupiter opposition). 


Cycle turn dates in XJO that makes the saw tooth pattern:

I found my research on those 10 turns and the work I did on Jupiter/Uranus .3 on Geocentric move 10. I had 2 dates 07-20-99 and 10-19-99 and I found the other turn of 03-23-00 and all 3 of these dates were around an angular separation of 282 degrees. The first date was 07-20-99, which was a high, the second date was 10-15-99 and looking at the data that was a low, the third date was 03-22-00 and again looking at the data that was a beautiful high. I could hardly catch my breath, there was my high low high saw tooth, staring back at me from the data. Man its beautiful. 

pg. 20

The author could sense that he would succeed someday in financial markets and be a great trader.  He never missed a day of repeating his words (mantra).  

pg. 22

About cycle mechanics:

Source Q: "Right, you are definitely on the right track, these cycles run all through stocks and commodities. There are cycles that are operating in the Wheat market today that I have found operating exactly the same in data back in the 1800’s. The cycles keep making there marks decade after decade, this means once you have found a strong cycle operating in a stock/commodity you can track it all the way back. No cycle exists by itself; the cycles operating simultaneously in your stock/commodity are constantly impacting each other. You may find that one pivot of your stock/commodity is a strong, well pronounced turn, the next pivot may be say a high coming in but a larger cycle makes a low three days prior. That high will be there but it will be distorted, harder to find, less pronounced. In the beginning, finding these cycles can be a bit of an art form but once certain principles are discovered and adhered to the road smoothes out and becomes extremely simple. It’s getting to that point, the struggle, the uncertainty, that stops so many, the lack of focus on understanding cycles, and yet this is key. Without any form of cycle you have chaos, it is difficult if not impossible to trade chaos as most find out the hard way.

Gann, Jensen and Bayer all wrote about cycles.  Cycles are where you make your money.  

pg. 23, 24

Cycle hunting technique/process:

The goal is to follow up this research in a more revealing method (instead of getting sporatic results).  By selecting only good turns, the author was in essence, telling the market where the cycle should be.  Instead, take all the significant highs and lows and over a 10-year period or more, and look where Jupiter/Uranus geocentric was at in each of the turns.  The author averaged about 8 turns per year, with a total of about 84 turns.  


pg. 25

You have to make sure that the cycles you find adhere to specific rules, because if they don't, you don't have cycles, you have coincidence.  It needs to be high, low, high, low pattern, and the inversion rate should be about 15%.  If a cycle doesn't adhere to that, then you don't ahve a cycle, you have coincidence.  

pg. 26

For stocks:

Jensen's ACSM, pg. 82: "Keep in mind the specific angular relationships of Jupiter, Saturn, and Uranus are they KEY to stocks in the plus or minus..."

Jensen's ACSM, pg. 83: "Primary attention should be directed to Uranus, Saturn, and Jupiter."

So there are only three combinations here:
Jupiter/Saturn
Jupiter/Uranus
Saturn/Uranus

pg. 26, 27

About the "heliocentric problem":

Over that weekend most of that list was knocked out except for a couple small projects that would take me about an hour a piece. Yeah, I was walking around doing things but my mind, was bent on working out the heliocentric problem. Heliocentric has no retrograde motion therefore the planetary movement is more uniform. Had observed in geocentric that the cycle would run like this; days between turns; 20, 15, 12, 10, 12, 15, 20, 43, 13 etc. because of retrograde, whereas a Heliocentric cycle could cover the same ground like this; days between turns; 13, 13, 14, 14, 14, 15, 15, 15 etc.

This “more uniform” rate, I felt, could be used to find the cycle because it was a characteristic of that cycle. Am going to have to devise a method of testing that could utilize that.



pg. 27

The word repeitions (mantra) were helping tremendously, and the author felt compelled to understand the cycles.  This "compelled" feeling was barely noticeable at first, but now it is more of a compelling drive, a strong need to understand cycles.  



About cycles:

If there were say 7 cycles in a stock or commodity that control that instrument then it makes great sense that once these are properly known and their "tracks" understood, that prediction can follow. Recalled that I have been told many times that stocks/commodities contain both Heliocentric and Geocentric cycles, sometimes working side by side. 


pg. 29, 30

Causes of self-sabbatage or causes for people not succeeding:

1) Location: Locality astrology blocks people.
2) We much be researchers.  Research includes long hours of intensive study and sacrifice.  
3) Belief system can stop people.  Some people are not in it to trade, althought they say they are.  They are in it for the knowledge or some are in it for the thrill of the chase.  

pg. 30-51

[Several charts are included and explanations for each of them.  This is basically showing concepts related to cycles and how they look.  There is a helio cycle in this and the solution is given on page 53 and 57.]


pg. 52

How do you know you are on the right track?  
Answer: As long as your focus remains on cycles, you are on teh right track.  

There are different types of cycles.  Some types work together or overlap in a unique manner.  Some can be used or combined with others to increase overall effectiveness.  Your eventual goal is to find these connections, find the interactions, and understand how everything works together in one large symphony. Trading through, trading can commence before everything is fully understood on these levels. For so many the first objective is to get to the point where you can trade and this is rightly so, then, the next goal is to improve, continue to improve and refine your system.

pg. 53

XJO dates for helio cycle testing:
09-15-2000 High
09-22-2000 Low
10-03-2000 High

pg. 57

I ran those 3 dates [for a helio cycle in XJO, page 53] forward and man it started to hit really good. After I had more hits I kept checking back with the ephemeris, this went on for quite sometime, ephemeris turn, ephemeris turn. The same number kept popping up so I took the average and ran that forward; high boom, low boom, right where my ephemeris said that they would be. Holy Hell this is a cycle! 

After work the following day I hit the cycle again, wanted to work with it more, become better acquainted, high, low, high etc. I got to an area and projected out, my target date was 05-15-02 but looking at that point is the turn on the 17th as a high or is it on the 13th as a low? What I had grown accustomed to doing was going to the next pivot of the cycle and seeing what it was. Like if you had a High, then high, you know the question mark was a low. If you had low, then low then you know the question mark was a high. If you have a low, then High it could be either, haven’t figured this out yet. So when I came across it I just put a question mark there and pick the cycle up a pivot or so later. 

This particular pivot held my interest. Went to the couch to try and mentally work it out. Sent an email to source Q: ”How can you know for sure which one of these turns actually belongs to my heliocentric cycle? Oh, and by the way, I found my first Heliocentric cycle!” 

Source Q wrote back. What the email said not only shocked me, it set the course of my studies: 

"You have a valid point, how to determine which one of these points is the actual turn in your cycle. The truthful answer is that each cycle has it own price points, given that, only one of those 2 points should tie in with that cycle. What I am telling you is that once you have an understanding of price you will know which point belongs in your cycle, from your current point of understanding you will have to pass on that pivot, come back later when you have more understanding.

pg. 58

[Source Q's email, cont.]

The main drawback to success for those studying the markets is that most try to tell the market what it should be doing, like say you have an allowable acceptance of being 2 days off on a cycle and come across a pivot that is 3 days out. If you respond that it can’t do that you are telling the market what it should be doing instead of isolating why that happened. In order to put the whole system together you will have to accept some things up front, then come back to them and refine them on a different level, an example of this being the 2 points that you emailed me about.

Another point is orb. In reality there is not orb. For these types of cycles when you understand price you will have then, at that point, the solution to orb. In Jensen’s book he talks about ‘depending on the declination’ that does not apply to what I am leading you to with the cycle we have here, though it does apply to something else. So here, in this particular cycle you need to make a thorough study of it. Work with your pivots and refine them look for additional connections. I will repeat, when you understand price you will understand orb. Although orb is not price or the actual price point there is something you need to understand to get price, with that understanding you will have orb.

This may sound like a twisting of words but you can also use price itself as a trade trigger down the road, though when you get to this point you won’t need to. What is this something else? It is a special way that a cycle works. Finding a cycle and understanding it’s secrets are different. Study it until you find the secrets within..."
