pg. 1

You have found the cycle that I was actually showing in those 20 charts that I sent you [in Cycle Hunter 2, pg. 30-51.  Solution was in Cycle Hunter 1, pg. 53, 57.].  Very good.  What I did was there was every third pivot to that cycle was shown and it was late so these is one noticable error.  


About cycles:

What is important to remember at this point for you is this cycle is not alone, there are other cycles impacting it.  Fortunately you have a limited number of cycles operating in your stock or commodity.  

The same cycle operating hundreds of years ago are still operative now, provided the same exact instrument still trades.  You can follow its tracks back or forward.  


Systemization is important:

Although you will be dealing with other cycles, you are going to have to systemize in order to minimize, there is a rhyme you will find, to make sense out of it, this is part of the refinement that I have been talking about. Finding something is not enough, you must THINK how to utilize this; there are ways.”


About finding which stock or commodity to trade:

How should one decide which stock or commodity to trade?  Most people just want to trade a particular something, but that will only work if you vibrate well to it.  There is a technique for finding out what you vibrate to (it is not mentioned here).  One thing you can also do is use your trading history as a gauge.  Which stocks and commodities have you been profitable with?  Stick to what is good to you.

Often times traders will trade successfully in one particular instrument, then they will use those winnings to trade another instrument, one that does not vibe to them, and then they will lose all or most of the money. The moral was to stick with what works and makes the most money.  The next step would be to put these under a microscope to find a good cycle.


pg. 2

Trading one cycle, by itself, is extremely dangerous.  


About simulating trades and paper trading:

In the beginning, where you are at is where most people make large, costly mistakes.  This is where simulating and doing paper trades is helpful. Those already trading can improve on their systems slowly and cautiously. You, not yet trading, should set up a series of staged trades like this; go back a couple of years with your system, that way the data is there. Say you go back to June 1, 2005. Then load in June 2, then June 3 and so on. That way it appears “real time” cause you wont know the future dates until you load them in and you don’t have to wait each day. This allows for quick testing, again, without having to wait for tomorrow’s data. When you overcome this, to you satisfaction, then try simulating. This is “ paper trading”. Trading is a business; you are in it to make money. If you are not successful in simulation, most likely you will fail in real time. 

Failure in simulation is a sign that you need to go back to the drawing board, that there is a flaw or an oversight in that particular trading plan for you. W.D. Gann when starting out had problems that he had to overcome in his trading as well. Fortunately, once discovered, the market can provide us with answers and solutions as it did W.D. Gann. 



pg. 4

Author talks about the typical retirement that people dream of actually being an illusion (for most).  It is a step down in pay while trying to maintain the same lifestyle.  Then disease sets in a few years later and most are gone.  

Author talked to people in their 80's; some had succeeded on their own.  Things that were gleaned from these older people:

1) We reap what we sow.

2) Old people never regretted anything that they had done, only what they had NOT done.  This may sound counter-intuitive until viewed from the view point of someone whose best years were far behind them.  

3) The best years for 99.9% of people were before retirement.  This is due to vigor and ambition generally diminishing with age.  Most arrive at retirement to realize that their best years are behind them (the years they could have made a difference in their lives).  


Everyone at the work place was in a true state of misery with most hanging on by a thread, none ever admitting it. We all acted like friends but in reality it was mutual misery. Misery loves company and there was certainly plenty of it around here. Personally, I could never find a commonality with these people and can tell you that since studying the “Instant Millionaire” by Mark Fisher there was a greater distance between myself and these co-workers, so much so that the negative attitudes of these coworkers became more pronounced as I began to see their own self limiting affects that these people were experiencing.  It occurred to me that internally the negative attitudes, of the hopeless co-workers, was beginning to become harder to stomach. 

pg. 6

The true essence of Gann's TTTA book: It teaches you how to read the Bible and what the Bible is really about.

pg. 7

Source F about TTTA:

Few people know it but the day Robert became the Supreme Commander is a very important day which anchors something of importance but I do not know what. I know for sure according to Source G that you can’t operate the Square of 9 without fully understanding Robert Gordon’s 7 days, at least the true way Gann used it.


Source B about not quitting your job:

Moved on to Source ‘B’s email, he stated; “There is something that I need to warn you about, not that you would make this mistake but others have, unfortunately. Do not quit your job until you have many years worth of income saved up and moreover do not get into money jams. By this I mean do not go out on a limb disregarding your obligations or responsibilities. Sometimes in this field individuals feel they need more study time or focus and to achieve it they go out on a limb in their life. This is incorrect and dangerous. Always play it safe. Money does change everything; you must wait for the money, no matter how much you dislike your job. Money follows knowledge, remember this, always.” Interesting but I already understood this. Sure, quit the dump I am working at eventually but with “balance” not by going out on a limb.

pg. 8

Author decides to risk only 10% of account on any one trade.  Once something is found that can be repeated over and over, that's when he will up the bet.  


Bttlc Proposition is a trigger system that can be used until something is found that works better.  

pg. 9

About finding the cause of inversions:

The problem of inversions must be dealth with before any serious trading can begin.

Source Q: "There are actually different types of cycles of which you have found one type, non-the-less a very important cycle. The procedure for isolating the cause is to first go through about 12 years or more, pull out the inversions that you find and make a list. Then the goal is to find the common element, present in the list. Initially this may take some time as you go through the elements one by one but you will eventually, be rewarded once you isolate the element that is responsible. You know that your cycles initially can be a day or two off, when you are testing elements for inversions use the day the turn actually happened, known as the physical turn date. If you are unsure whether a turn is actually an inversion or not leave it alone.  Here is the key, that list you make will contain errors so look for a 'majority' consensus."

The author's guess was that the cause of inversions was declination, so he listed the declination for the dates that were on his list of inversions.  When he went down the list looking for a pattern, he did not see a pattern.

pg. 10

About finding the cause of inversions (cont.):

Worked late that night finally at some strangely late hour after going through the possible elements, meticulously I met with success. There it was! Spent the next hour double-checking the results as this would lead to me putting “money on the line” did not want to take any more chances. It was there alright, just like Source ‘Q’ had stated and there were a few errors that did not seem to tie in with it all, thinking on it, if you don’t know that, you would have thought that there was still another element out there. My calculations were checked very carefully. Then went back to see what had happened to my inversion’s that did not fit with the element.

A couple of them were close to it so checked those first and found that what had been done was the previous or next turn to the one that had originally been marked as an inversion was the correct one, which would then fit nicely into the appropriate element. Then there were a few that were just plain wrong, way off, so chocked those up to human nature. That’s the last thing I remember before waking up on the couch late that next morning with ideas and numbers still running through my head. Made the final camping preparations, filled the cooler, decided to spend the rest of the day finding inversions in the other cycles that were originally worked with. These things take several hours to set up cause you have to go through years worth of data to collect the inversions. 


pg. 10-11

About goals:

Made it a personal goal to acquire a good size tract of undeveloped land [so he can go camping on it]; the only way that this is going to happen is through trading. From what I understand about success, it is best to have goals like this as it keeps you focused.

Make a full goal list and think on exactly what your goals are.  Get them on paper.  When you have goals it's different because without goals you are going to wind up somewhere else.  A goal acts as a destination.  

pg. 11

Source B:
No one cycle exists by itself. You have to be aware of this; my trading system utilizes this fact to its advantage. What I do is this, get 2 of the strongest cycles in your stock or commodity, find the inversions (I then go on to acquire the price points of the turns for each cycle but you don’t have to do that as you can simply use time instead). Build a spreadsheet by using 3 columns the first column on the left hand side put the dates running down that column including weekends, the next column over put your first cycle. If its going up (the cycle) use green cells, if its going down put red cells, the next column over do the same thing for your strong second cycle.

Here is how it works, when both cells are green I go long; when both cells are red I buy puts. Now later when you know your price points for each cycle you can put those in for each cycle, like where you go from red to green or green to red, put your price points in. this technique produces great results, the key is to make sure both of your cycles are strong. As you are finding out everyone thinks that the number that produces the cycles is 15 when in reality this number is whatever the stock or commodity vibrates to. A saying, for repetition is (everyday I am becoming a successful trader) this will greatly aid you as it has me over the years. You are still going to make mistakes and that is natural as long as you take a look at why the trade failed.

pg. 12

Source B (cont.):
I am including a chart that shows the technique of finding the second cycle.
[Chart included.]

So, you see it is very important to find at least two of the stronger cycles in your stock or commodity. That is a mandatory first step. There are different cycle types sometimes but when you find them you will know.

Author:
If there are a limited number of cycles in a stock then it would make sense that using two together would be more powerful. 

pg. 13

Author: For the first time in my life I was alive, really alive because I was on the trail again, of those childhood dreams.


Two spots for the Bttlc Proposition in Apple:
9 deg 42 min
10 deg 12 min

This was obtained using the technique in the work "12".  

Based on these two spots, the others (by adding 15) are:
24 deg 42 min
25 deg 12 min


[rluu: The 'Bttlc Proposition' appears to be simply a trigger system using the 15-degree axis talked about in "12".]

[rluu: pg. 20 says that he uses 2 days orb either side of the expected cycle date for applying the 'Bttlc Proposition' trigger.]


Affirmations the author is doing:
"Everyday I am becoming a better trader"
"Everyday I understand cycles better"

The second one has had a tremendous impact on his study skills.  It kept him focused even when he wasn't studying.  


Now I am at the point of trading.  Now, looking back I can see that it may not have been the quickest path but sure am glad to be here, at this point, looking on to a beautiful future. Looking back, at several points on the path, can now see where I was going wrong and becoming frustrated was due to a balance problem just like Source 'B' originally diagnosed. 


pg. 14

About Gann's Master Time Factor (MTF):

Source Q: "Gann’s Master Time Factor is actually a short cut, it’s a point around where the other time factor’s tie into. Once you get the Master Time Factor you will more quickly be able to acquire the time factors of the other numbers, thus, in that, it is a short cut."

pg. 16

Source B:

Congratulations on your trade, keep in mind that the first two days when your trade was going against you, it was because either a second cycle bottomed on that second day or you were a couple days off on your cycle. 

Keep in mind that the true cause of orb is properly understood through the use and understanding of time factors.



About getting price:

I turned my focus to price, spent the evening rereading emails and old posts from the site that I belong to. On the site there was some information about squaring price out with certain planets. This squaring seemed to be very precise, but the question is, how does one know which planet you will be squaring out with? Reread the posts carefully and laid down on the thinking couch.

It soon became clear to me that the only way to find out was to take my cycles and do a massive study, probably 2 to 3 years of pivots. Take those and analyze them, its either that or ask ‘B’ or ‘Q’ for some help but they are going to wonder why I have not at least made one serious attempt at it. What was decided as a plan of action was to write out the dates of the physical highs and lows then go back and see which planet a turn would square out with. Completed the list of turns and started checking the dates to see what they squared out with. The first one, according to the instructions in the site, squared out with Transpluto but the next 3 did not square out with anything. Next one squared out with Mars but the following 2 nothing. Continued on down the list. 68% squared out with absolutely nothing, of the remaining 32% it was a hodge podge, hit and miss.

It occurred to me there was a problem here, all this is way random. Went back and double-checked both my answers and the data a certain points, everything seemed to be in order, then why coincidence? Went over to the couch to dwell on why coincidence, why nothing matched. The answer finally came to me. How does one handle stock splits for squaring? A stock split is a man made phenomena so you would have to factor the split out, at least this was my theory, so will have to back through the data on Apple at some future date.


pg. 18

Regarding "down time" when the system does not signal a trade:

For Apple there is nothing I can do cause it’s a system, my trading system, that is adhered to. The solution struck me, as they often do; need another stock, another cycle in a stock to trade so that there is more trading opportunity without risking more capital. Already know that the system that I use is universal, Source 'B' and 'Q' always said to stick with stocks and commodities that like me.


About "Law of Vibration":

Source N:

Gann had started with and made money with these cycles but then had found the biggest secret of all and used primarily what he called the “law of vibration”. He went on to say that this law of vibration is also cleverly disguised in the Tunnel Book. This means more things that will eventually need to be studied. 


pg. 18-19

About price (on Apple):

Next thing on my ever-growing list was to acquire the Apple stock splits. There were 3 splits that were 2 for 1. So 2x2x2 equals 8. That means that I will have to multiply each high, low, close, etc. by a factor of 8 to get what it is truly trading at.

So like let’s say a daily hi/lo Bar of 82 low to 85.5 Hi would be a low of 656 and a Hi of 684. So how this will have to be done is, the data gets exported into a spreadsheet, and then each cell is multiplied by 8. The date for the row is transferred over, and then the RESULTS are copied and pasted into a new spreadsheet. This new spreadsheet is then put into the charting software and Wa-La. What I noticed off the bat is Apples prices in 2002 that were around 7 are now above 50. This is good news because I have heard that when a stock is selling below 30 it won’t act right, Gann himself advised people to stay away from anything selling under 30.

My next step, according to the instructions on the site, is to find what circle that Apple is operating in. After a “run” with the circle of 12 what I saw looked like more coincidence so I tested other numbers because Gann actually had charts that the scaling would change half way up the chart to the next Octave. After many hours I had, what appeared to me, to be a squaring situation, continued to square out all of the dates of the turns. Grabbed some lunch then came back for the analysis.

It appeared that one planet controlled the tops while another one controlled the bottoms, this is awesome! Will have to do more research to see how to blend this into my system, but realized because I am restricted to buying and selling over lunch all that it can be used for, with me anyway, is to verify that a top or bottom has already come in, but to someone with open access, could see that this could be used as a powerful trade trigger.

pg. 20

No trade is placed if there is no trigger by the Bttlc Proposition.  He uses 2 days either side of the cycle turn date for looking for a trigger.  

pg. 22

About Cycle Master:

Definition: A Cycle Master is a person who has found 20 or more cycles in various stocks and commodities.

When you have found 20 cycles, you understand much better, not only short cuts to cycle hunting, but cycle mechanics that lead to an understanding of why price goes up or down fast.  When you become a cycle master, you start seeing certain things and set ups repeat.  It should be your goal to become a cycle master.

The only true way for cycles to cough up their secrets is for you to learn their ways by experience.  Most find a cycle or two then try and find the price solution or something else. What they really need to do, this step is critical for success, is to become a cycle master by doing cycles in both stocks and commodities, even an index.

pg. 23

The amount of knowledge gained by doing this is phenomenal. You must try and find more than one cycle in a stock or commodity. You have been trading one cycle, this I do not recommend.” Interrupted at that point and told him about my last trades, his response was acute; “many let dollar signs cloud their judgment even if they find a cycle they fail to fully understand the cycles. A cycle master does not make this grave error. He is someone that has done 20 or more cycles. Few reach this title, you; you my friend must reach this point. You must become a ‘Cycle Master’.

We talked about price, not about how it works but how I get to it. He stated that “thinking of a house and the foundation of a house being the cycles, the second floor being price, it is critical that the foundation (cycles) is as strong as possible or it will collapse, making the upper floors impossible;” again the importance of being a cycle master.


pg. 23-24

About cyles:

 Source ‘B’ then stated “Do large cycles as well as small, you work with small cycles in your trading so you have no use for larger cycles but the catch 22 is you are unaware of how the larger cycles work. A cycle Master would not have made this error.

Jensen states to use Jupiter, Saturn and Uranus here; this makes it much easier. Spend some time with these as well. Now I will tell you how to do these cycles in your charting software, most use arrows at cycle tops and bottoms, use lines. Use lines because this will aid in your understanding graphically, by lines I mean connect the cycle Highs and Lows to each other by lines. As you know, say you have a cycle that is running in 15 degree increments but what most do not know is that it may not be on the 15’s, as an example, the numbers could run 25, 40, 55, 70 etc. This is what stops so many from understanding cycles, along those lines 15 is not the only number there are many others as you are becoming aware of. You may have heard rumors or read that you need to do phase shifts. Non-Sense, when you get into difficult complicated things you are off track.

When I first started out I took 1896 wheat data, found a cycle and ran it forward to 2002, it was the same cycle going High, Low, High, Low. In that cycle and all the others I use in my own trading all the cycles I have found period, nothing has ever shifted anywhere, except in an index, one in particular that they keep switching out the components of. Save you more time, on your large cycles where you use at least a weekly chart, use geocentric then test Helio. You must take a look at those on your way to be a cycle master!” 

pg. 24

About cycles:

He pointed to the day after highs and lows, stating, “look at these, what is occurring is very similar to the movie Armageddon with Bruce Willis, in that movie they sling shot around the Moon. Price does exactly that around a turning point, called a ‘point of force’. This means that the following day, after the price point is hit, sees price being thrown in the opposite direction from which it came. Once grasped, this is a powerful concept to understand and implement, there are others. Let’s look at one.

As you can see on this other chart I use lines to connect the Highs and Lows. I run a cycle through, like this one here, then focus in on the turns that are left this shows location of another cycle which is pivoting.” He showed me more and more of his work and explained different cycle set-ups that happen over and over, that can be identified and traded, set-ups that only cycle masters are aware of. 

pg. 25-26

About cycles:

On my way out a group was talking about that in a cycle, the High that the [typical non-cycle analyst] would use might be caused by another cycle, other than the one under observation, joined in to that group. They were saying that the actual turn for the cycle you are following could occur at a place where the price action moves from a sideways market to a down or up-trend, had noticed this myself at points in my cycles. He said you have to follow the rules, if the exact top is “out of orb” it can not be used, its caused by another cycle.

Told the group that that was where I had problems just starting out, always wanted to use extreme Highs and Lows, then later down the road, there was the realization that the cycle pivots weren’t always large clear tops, you have to take what the cycle gives you, not the other way around. 

One of the guys was confused so the other explained it like this; “Say you have a cycle that goes High, Low, High every 14 days on a Wednesday, as an example, you are expecting it to make a High next Wednesday (in 8 days) but there is a large top that came in today, tomorrows price action goes down below the high bar, then the next day goes sideways until next Tuesday then drops down fast and hard. Now the actual top there was the High a week before.

This is too far from our pivot, its not our 14 day cycle High, it is caused by a different cycle. Our High came in one day early, on Tuesday and is visible by a fast price collapse.” 

pg. 26

About weekends:

Pivots can happen behind the “closed doors” of a weekend. Had noticed this in my own studies as well, market going up on a Friday, cycle pivots over weekend, Monday opens up and goes down. Like Jensen says “it does not halt a cycle of time”.


About 'Banner Years':

"Banner Years", where things run a lot better and people seem in a better overall stance, occurs when there are hardly any bad aspects between the outer planets.

pg. 27


About the Uranus cycle of 84 years:

Regarding a big company that failed, that the feds had to bail out, he said “the name has been around for 85 years, that’s a Uranus cycle of 84 years so there it is again, anyone knowing the age of that company and astrology could have known, the company itself vigorously denied any problems up until the week before. Half of the 84 year cycle, 42 years is another bad time”.


About cycles (double tops and bottoms):

Double tops and bottoms are created by 2 separate cycles, both peaking out around the same time, which had followed a nice run up or down.


About cycles (sideways markets):

A sideways market is caused by the outer planetary cycles that are, at that point, conflicting. One or more are headed up while one or more are headed down, counter-balancing each other. Knowing the location and the direction of the cycles will give indication when the trend will change up or down.


About cycle strength:

 He was a cycle master and told us his method of determining a cycle’s strength. He said there were different methods but that one was to look at a point where one cycle was going up, the other cycle down and see which one price followed, up or down. He went on that if there were three cycles it could still be done, just needed to study different sections. Could see by these guys that becoming a cycle master definitely had its perks, they seemed so much more advanced than myself.



One guy at the seminar was taking Solar Returns and timing markets to the day.


pg. 28

About orb for cycles:

About the orb used on the outer planets: "One is about 10 days either side, one is 20 and the other 30."


pg. 30

About which trigger to take (in Bttlc Proposition):

If the author had taken the first indication (trigger) on the Low, he would have made a lot more.  He said he needs to back test this scenario to see if I need to modify the system according to indication.

[rluu: In Cycle Hunter 4, he says he uses the first indication/trigger (in Apple) when there is more than one indication/trigger date for a given cycle pivot.]

pg. 5-6

About the use of triggers in personal astrology:

We recently made a discovery based off the work of R.N. Nelson back in the 1960’s. Nelson found out that when Jupiter and Saturn were at 0, 90 or 180 degrees apart it would interfere with radio communications around the world. Most importantly the “worst days” were when a triggering planet would come into the aspect! 

Applying this in our personal lives reveals a hidden secret. Let’s say your natal Moon is at 11 Taurus, as an example and transiting Neptune is at 8 Taurus, 3 degrees away from a conjunction geocentrically. Now this transit, because it is applying and Neptune is getting closer, is building in intensity, here is the key; when faster transiting planets namely, Mercury, Sun, Mars and Moon conjunct transiting Neptune there will be events and happenings, as it will trigger that off. In this example transiting Neptune is at 8 Taurus. When a trigger gets to 6 Taurus (conjuncting Neptune) you will see its affects, profoundly. You can use this powerful technique to exactly time and thus correctly understand important events. Neptune is used here because it moves slowly, it could also be Saturn, Uranus, Chiron, and Pluto etc., and likewise we used Neptune conjuncting Moon. The same principal applies to Neptune square or opposed a natal planet.

Let’s run over another example. Let’s say your natal Pluto is at 28 Virgo and transiting Pluto is at 26 Sagittarius (applying to a square). When transiting geocentric Sun, Moon, Mercury or Mars hits 24 Sagittarius you are going to feel it. After the trigger moves on, the square aspect will continue to manifest as a “bad time period” but the EVENTS are timed by the triggers.

This technique is incredibly insightful as it removes the uncertainty that always accompanies these longer transits. Like in our example of Pluto square Pluto, this aspect can be applying for 4 months in some cases. Obviously events will not happen every day of that. Intensity of the events appear to correspond with 2 factors, one of which is the distance of the transiting slower planet to the exact natal position. When Pluto is 6 degrees and applying to natal Pluto the event will be weak when triggered because of the distance of 6 degrees applying. Say Pluto is 2 degrees from squaring natal Pluto, the events, triggered by the faster planets will be much more intense.

The second factor is the speed of the trigger at the time of triggering. The slower the more intense. Mercury as trigger generally brings bad news or bad communications. Sun brings the ego into it and Mars brings events that can logically be concluded from that Planet. Never underestimate this technique. So you can see the implications of this field go far beyond acquisition of money, it brings understanding.
