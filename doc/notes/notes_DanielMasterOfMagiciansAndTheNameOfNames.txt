pg. 3

The 14th verse of hte first chapter of Genesis speaks of the lights of heaven as being for signs, and the Hebrew original shows clearly that these signs are more than mere indicators of time periods.  


pg. 4

About astrology ruling:

The 19th Psalm begins:
"The heavens declare the glory of God."

The 4th verse, in the Authorized Version:
"Their line is gone out through all the earth, and their words to the end of the world."

pg. 5

The number of the Greek name IESOUS (Jesus) is 888.


According to the doctrin fo the Western School of occultism, all phenomena are manifestations of a single power, designated at the beginning of St. John's gospel as the Logos, or Word.  

pg. 6

"The kingdom of heaven" is actually "The rule of the heavens".  

pg. 7

Ezekiel's four living creatures were on the standards of four tribes of Israel.

Judah = Lion
Dan = Eagle
Ephraim = Ox
Manasseh = Man

All of this is purely astrological.


The elements associated with these animals are associated with JHVH:
J --> Fire
H --> Water
V --> Air
H --> Earth

pg. 8

The signs of the zodiac for these animals:
5 + 8 + 11 + 2 = 26 = JHVH


The following are associated with the 12 signs of the zodiac:
  - The 12 tribes of Israel.
  - The 12 stones in the high-priests breastplate.
  - The gates and foundations of the New Jerusalem described in the Book of Revelation.  

pg. 8-9 and pg. 33

Correct horoscope of the Declaration of Independence:
Ascendant:  13 Scorpio

United States of America has 21 letters.
National motto: "E pluribus Unum" has 13 letters.

pg. 11

to know the courses of the stars is to be able, at all times, to utilize their influences constructively, and so to depart from the bondage of chance, self-will and evil into the perfect freedom of those who make obedience to the heavenly order the basis of their thought and action.  

pg. 12

Daniel was chief astrologer at the Babylonian court, under Nebuchadnezzar and Belshazzar, and continued in that office until the first year of the reign of Cyrus.  

pg. 14

As reward for his success in interpreting the king's dream, Daniel was made master of the magicians.  This was his official title according to the translation of the Authorized Version; but the original text calls him "rab chartomia", or "master of the astrologers."


People cite this passage as condemnation of astrology:

Law of Moses, in Deuteronomy 18:10-12, says that the use of divination, or an observer of times, or an enchanter, or a witch, or a charmer, or a consulter with familiar spirits, or a wizard, or a necromancer, are abominations unto Jehovah.  

pg. 15

Refuting the condemnation of astrology:

Daniel must have known it, but had no scruples against being made chief of the Chaldean wise men, who are described in the KJV as "magicians, astrologers, Chaldeans and soothsayers."  Daniel risked his life again and again rather than violate the Mosaic code.  We can conclude then that the practices of the Chaldeans involved no transgressions against the law of Moses. 

pg. 18

Astrology emphasizes order, the law of cause and effect; and behind that law it discovers and adores the great lawgiver, God himself.  

pg. 19

Three terms used in the Book of Daniel:

  - "magician".  
    This really means "astrologer", or "caster of horoscopes."

  - "astrologer"
    That which is translated as this would be more accurately rendered "enchanter", for it signifies a person skilled in the correlation of various kinds of vibration, and the control of various kinds of vibration through the use of sound.  
  - "Chaldeans".
    This was the official designation of the priestly caste in Babylonia, who were much occupied with astronomical observations.  

  - "Soothsayers"
    A poor translation of "gezaria" which means determiners of destiny."


Thus, "Chaldeans" meant one of three kinds of wise men:
1) The makers of horoscopes.
2) The practitioners of the art of controlling vibration by sound.
3) The persons who specialized in judging horoscopes.  

pg. 20-25

[Dream recorded in the 2nd chapter of the Book of Daniel, supplemented by visions recorded in the 7th, 8th, 10th, 11th, and 12th chapters.]

Four parts of the image represent the four world empires.

Head             : Gold         (Sun)   : Babylonians
Breast and arms  : Silver       (Moon)  : Medes and Persians
Belly and thighs : Copper/Brass (Venus) : Greeks
Legs and feet    : Iron         (Mars)  : Romans


pg. 25

The 4th chapter of Daniel is a vision of four beasts:
1) Lion with eagles wings, represents Babylonian empire.
2) Like a bear, represents Medes and Persians.
3) Like a leopard, having 4 wings like a fowl, and 4 heads, represents Greek empire, which in its later stages was actually divided into four parts, or heads.
4) With iron teeth, has 10 horns, amongst which rises another little horn.  These horns represent the kingdoms into which the Roman empire was divided after fall of the central power.

pg. 28

Dan 7:12 says:
"They had their DOMINION taken away, yet their LIVES were prolonged; Persia remains distinct from Greece, and Greece from Rome."


"The times of the Gentiles" covers a "great week" (360 years * 7 = 2520 years).

pg. 29

"time" = year of 360 days, in which each day corresponds to an ordinary year.

This great week of 2520 years is reckoned according to three scales:
  - Lunar scale, corresponding to the sacred year of the Jews and Mohammedans, and consisting of 354 days.  
  - Egyptian and astrological calendar of 360 days.
  - Solar year of 365 days.

pg. 32

In the 8th chapter of Daniel a period of 2300 days is mentioned, corresponding to 2300 years.  

pg. 33-34

49th chapter of Genesis:
"The sceptre shall not depart from Judah until Shiloh come."

"Iba Shiloh" == "Shiloh shall come"
Iba = 13
Shiloh = 345

345 = Moses (MshH)
    = The divine name "El Shaddai", "Almighty God"
    = Rabbinical word signifying "the end".

345 are the numbers in a 3-4-5 triangle.

pg. 34-35

The US was founded on the law of Moses, and in the Declaration of Independence, as in the symbolism of the seal, it gives full recognition to Almighty God, as the lawgiver whence proceeds the order of the heavens.  The fulfillment of the American idea is what is represented by the stone in Nebuchadnezzar's dream.

pg. 35-36

Daniel, by the study of books which he mentions, and by his knowledge of astrological cycles, was able to predict the exact time of the beginning of the end of the "times of the gEntiles."  That was the year 1776 A.D.

pg. 36-37

"ehben" (ABN) == stone

First two letters of "ehben" (ABN) is:
"AB" == father.
This is the name assigned by the Qabalistic Rabbis to that aspect of Reality which they call Wisdom.  To Wisdom, they assign "Masloth".

"Masloth" == the word used in the Bible to describe the zodiac, and the way of the upright.  


Last two letters of "ehben" (ABN) is:
"ben" (BN) == the Son.
They assign this to that aspect of reality which they call Beauty, the sphere of the Sun.  [pg. 37] This refers to the human Self, to the I AM we all feel centered within us.  [pg. 38]  In other words, that which is the ruling power of the universe, and the source of all its laws, is identical witht he life-force which is us centers itself as the point of self-consciousness we call the "I AM."  This power is the servant of all mankind.  It is what Qabalists mean when they say that the name Ben, the Son, stands for the secret nature of the physical world.  It is what St. John meant when he wrote, concerning the Logos: "That which hath been made was life in him and the life was the light of men."  [pg. 38-39]

pg. 37

In Qabalistic psychology, Wisdom, sphere of the zodiac, is also the seat of the life-force of man.  That is to say, the Qabalists regard the life-force in every human body as being energy directly derived from the radiations of the stars, and as having its cycles of ebb and flow synchronized with the movements of those heavenly bodies.  


pg. 40

"Shiloh" == inner peace and tranquility.

pg. 42

Thus astrology reveals the hidden lines of connection between the life of man and the mind of God, and enables us to follow the highway of the stars, and thus depart from evil.

pg. 47

About names:

St. John 17:6:
n"I have manifested thy name to the men whom thou has given me out of the world.

St. John 17:26:
"I made known to them, and will make known, thy name; so that the love with which thou didst love me may be in them, and I in them."

pg. 49

In the Old Testament and the New Testament, there is great emphasis on proper names.  The various names of God, the names of angels, the names of persons, the names of places, are evidently regarded by biblical writers as being of great importance.  Knowledge of these names and of their meaning is evidently assumed to have a special value.  

pg. 50

There is a connection between the namesof the founders of hte tribes of Israel and the actual characters of the 12 sons of Jacob (Genesis chapter 49).  


In the Old Testament, Solomon built his temple, not to God himself, but to His name.  


pg. 51

Simon, the impetuous, hasty, unstable disciple, had his name changed to Peter, the rock.  

Meaning of some Bible names:

Peter = the rock
Paul = little

The gospel of St. Luke says St. John the Baptist was named by an angel.

St. Matthew tells us our Lord Himself was named by an angel who appeared to St. Joseph in a dream.


pg. 54

Naming something, we give that thing the spirit, meaning, dominant motive of that thing.  

pg. 56

The name Jesus is directly derived from the name of God most reverenced by the Children of Israel.  That name is fmailiar to readers of the English Bible as Jehovah. To this name Solomon built his temple.  It was Solomon's fame concerning his knowledge of the inner meaning of this name that came to the ears of the Queen of Sheba.  It was the supreme name of God which Moses revealed to the Children of Israel.  And it was this name which our Lord, a prophet like unto Moses, manifested to His disciples.  

pg. 60

The word Jehovah is not a name at all.  It is simply a designation.  The special merit of this word is that it does not define.  It simply indicates.  It is derived from a Hebrew verb meaning "to be," and its true import is simply this: "That which WAS, that which IS, that which WILL BE."

pg. 61

The prophets of Israel understood this word, and in their writing did not attach this name to a personal deity.

pg. 62

His name (Jesus) was a shortened form of the word Jehovah, with a Hebrew verbal suffix meaning, "to deliver, to liberate."  In the Aramaic language which He spoke, the Master's name was Yeshua, a contraction of yehoshua, better known to us as Joshua, the name of the successor of Moses.  Yehoshua or Yeshua became Jesous in Greek, Jesu in Latin, and Jesus in English.  Whatever the variants of spelling and pronunciation, the meaning is always the same: "That which WAS, that which IS, that which WILL BE, delivers."  Or we might paraphrase it thus: The essential nature of the Supreme Reality is to liberate.  

pg. 63

"Reality sets us free" is the true secret of the power of the name of Jesus.  

pg. 65 and pg. 74

Jesus is the Name of Names.  

pg. 67-68

What science calls natural law is what Jesus meant by God's will.

pg. 71

Oriental doctrine of Karma in the Bible, in the Lord's own words:
"With what measure ye mete, it shall be measured unto you again."

The words translated as "sin" in our English bible actually mean, "to miss the mark, to stray from the path."  To sin is to walk some other way than the one which leads to our goal.  To sin is to be headed in the wrong direction.  

pg. 73

The Way of Liberation is the Way of Love.  


Freedom for ourselves we cannot enjoy unless we are active in making freedom for others.  Joy for ourselves there cannot be unelss our living adds to the joy of others.  

[rluu: Is this true?  If our environment is a reflection of our inner self, then can these statements be true?  Have we always been free except that we have bound ourselves, and thus we can free ourselves at any moment?]

pg. 74-75

Satisfaction of the mind is not enough.  The mind is only a key to the heart, and it is in the heart that our Lord dwells.
