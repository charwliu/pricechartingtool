Tribute commemorating a decade of WITS.
Members helping members.

Why do some succeed and others do not?

It is because they need to know and understand:
Philosophy of SUCCESS.

Ability to achieve their dream in this field.

Success preparation.

Many simply have not been trained on the mentality of true success.

Is making 6 figures true success?

If I had 10 million dollars in my bank account, would I still want to be doing this job?  If the answer is no, then you are intrinsically not where you want to be.  

Job is one area of life, trading is another. 

The one thing that stops the individual from living their dreams, above all else, is themselves.  This is based on 8 months of intensive investigation.  


True success requires a conscious understanding of True Success.  There is no other way.


Principles of success.


There are two versions of Napolean Hill's book:
  - Public version. (BA says this version is watered down.)
  - Original version.  (BA calls this the secret version.)


Over the years BA has seen people who got close to success, but then
they self-sabatoged themselves.

True success is wealth.  Wealth is a byproduct of success.  And wealth is beyond money.  

The mindset of the individual. 


BA reads "Three feet from gold" from the Napolean book.  
Seek expert counsel before giving up.
Desire can be transmuted into gold.

Before success comes in any man's life, he sure to meet with much temporary defeat, and perhaps some failure.  When defeat overtakes a man, the easiest and most logical thing to do is quit.  That's exactly what the majority of men do.  

The man who thought his way into a job with Edison.
What that man said was not as important as what he thought.  IT WAS THE THOUGHT THAT COUNTED.

Stand by that desire until it becomes an obsession.

One of the tricks of opportunity.


Intangible thought can be transmuted into a physical counter-part by the application of known principles.

Clue to the Carnegie secret:
All achievement and earned riches have their beginning in an idea.  If you are ready for the secret, then you already possess one half of it.  Therefore you will readily recognize the second half the moment it reaches your mind.

1st half: is the desire.
2nd half: is in TTTA (for Gann knowledge).

Prove-it-to-me people don't need proof, they need success consciousness.  
What was stopping them was theirselves.  


What was stopping them was the lack of preparation.

BA is reading an excerpt from Napoleon Hill's Think and Grow Rich:
  - Success comes to those who become success conscious.
  - Failure comes to those who indifferently allow themselves to become failure conscious.  

Gann field uses:
1) System that uses planets and numbers.
2) System that uses numbers. 

Gann angles has it's place in one those two systems.


What's stopping people in this field is themselves.  

It's the mindset that's so crucial, that it can make you or break you.

Weakness: Habit of measuring everything and everyone by their own impressions and beliefs.  

Some who will read this will believe that no one can think and grow rich, they cannot think in terms of riches because their thought habits are stooped in povery, misery and defeat.  


Henry Ford had a thought and he believed in the thought.

Faith one's own ability to understand this field.

1995 BA started trading.  
Success of his Uncle (as proof) carried BA through the tough times. 

Mindset: Monitor your thoughts.  


Napoleon Hill on faith:
State of mind that may be induced by self-suggestion/auto-suggestion.  

Faith in yourself, faith in the infinite.

Faith is the eternal elixir which gives life, power, and action to the impulse of thought.  

Faith is the starting point of all accumulation of riches.  

It's what you believe that is so critical in your success.
You have to believe in yourself.  

This is the element that transforms the ordinary vibration of thought, created by the infinite mind of man, into the spiritual equivalent.  Faith is the only agency for which the cosmic force of infinite intelligence can be harnessed and used by man.  


Every man is what he is, because of the DOMINATING THOUGHTS which he permits to occupy his mind. Thoughts which a man deliberately places in his own mind, and encourages with sympathy, and with which he mixes any one or more of the emotions, constitute the motivating forces, which direct and control his every movement, act, and deed!


THOUGHTS WHICH ARE MIXED WITH ANY OF THE FEELINGS OF EMOTIONS, CONSTITUTE A "MAGNETIC" FORCE WHICH ATTRACTS, FROM THE VIBRATIONS OF THE ETHER, OTHER SIMILAR, OR RELATED THOUGHTS. A thought thus "magnetized" with emotion may be compared to a seed which, when planted in fertile soil, germinates, grows, and multiplies itself over and over again, until that which was originally one small seed, becomes countless millions of seeds of the SAME BRAND!

The ether is a great cosmic mass of eternal forces of vibration. It is made up of both destructive vibrations and constructive vibrations.  All of which maintain their own individuality, and means of identification, through the medium of radio.


BA: 
Like attracts like.  Monitor your thoughts.  See the bright side of things.  
You are in charge of your own success.

Your mindset above all else determines your success or failure.  

It's not looks, IQ, eduation, upbringing...  it is their MINDSET.

The mindset is the golden key.


Gann used:
1) System that uses planets and numbers.
2) System that uses numbers.


Both systems uses points in time in the past to forcast future points in time.

Once preparation is complete (i.e. planetary revolution, latitude, longitude, declination, etc.), the first priority for the Gann student to understand or find which points in time have a relationship.  

Gann understand this, and left a roadmap for those who came later.  This roadmap is in TTTA.  This book is written in a vieled language.  

Gann gives the systems he used.  He handles both of those systems in TTTA.

He handles the system that uses only numbers:
- By use of RG's 7 days, interlaced throughout the war periods.  

He handles the system that uses planets and numbers:
- Handled also in war period, but in reference to the air ships.
- Elements such as Demon of Death, sleeping gas, tie into the system that uses planets with numbers, but in a different area of the system that uses planets and numbers.

All these elements tie past points in time to the future points, giving the ability to forecast.  


Square of 9 is not a square, it's a calculator.  Solar-powered calculator.  It's what you do with the calculator that is important.  

The true key to understanding the use of the square of 9 can be gleamed from the tie points in the system that uses numbers only.  


BA:
The true beginning point presents itself when the individual:
- Vibrates to success.  
- Acquires the ability to forecast future points in time based off past points in time. 


The road to acquiring the true beginning point is the understanding of the air ships.  More specifically, one must hunt down how exactly W.D. Gann hid the repeats of time of the air ships.  


Once you have convinced yourself you truly can succeed in this field, you have already have succeeded.


BA says WITS has totally changed his life.  BA sincerely thanks WITS for everything it has done for his life.
