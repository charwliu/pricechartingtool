'Practical Feng Shui Astrology: Using the Nine Ki System to Make Important Decisions In Your Life'

About the Japanese system of 'Feng Shui': 
The flow of Ki follows a nine-year cycle (and within that, monthly, daily and even hourly cycles).

See page 108.

There are 9 types of Ki energy, each associated with a particular year, month, day and hour.
