'Oedipus Aegypticus' is a massive work of three volumes published in 1642, by Athanacius Kircher.

This work shows at a glance the probably planetary influence overshadowing may fo the ordinary problems and questions which daily and hourly confront the average person; the best time to commence important undertakings, the "time to sow and the time to reap," both mentally and materially.

pg. 7, 8

We attempt to theorize on the mystic power by which electricity travels unerringly from teh sending station to the telegraph key, almp or level with which it is in tune.  It moves that key, lights that lamp and pulls that lever, while leaving other keys, lamps or levers not in tune, undisturbed, or still greater mystery of the wireless by which the message is flashed to the middle of the ocean without any physical connection between the sending and receiving instruments.  We cannot explain the force we use, -- we can only give it a name and call it electricity or radio activity, -- but its real nature eludes us.  We know that there must be invisible forces in nature of which we are ignorant and by means of which these and many other marvels are accomplished.  Many not each human being be similarly influenced by stellar vibrations?

Each day given rulership of a planet.  Hours are also given rulership of a planet.  The ancient astrologers found that these planetary hours vibrated to the different planets in the order of their several rates of motion in the zodiac; the first hour after sunrise being ruled by the planet that govrned the day; not equal hours of 60 minutes, but each one twelfth (1/12) part of the time from sunrise to sunset, and the night hours divided in the same manner.  

Order of motion, beginning with the planet of longest period [this is the same order for planetary hours]:
Saturn
Jupiter
Mars
Sun
Venus
Mercury
Moon

Plate II, which is a photo reproduction from 'The Oedipi Aegyptici', a fine old work by Athanacius Kircher, printed in A. D. 1653.  [rluu: It looks like a figure eight, each loop of the eight being a spiral.] He obtained this illustration from a still older manuscript, probably about the 14th century, and it was not original even at that date.  'The Hieroglyph' shows the great way to be traversed by the soul on its progress through the worlds of matter in its search for experience and attainment.  

At the top is shown the spirit or soul starting from the Center of Divine Light on its journey through the world of matter.  The soul having once started on the path, must, with great labor and effort, follow the many twists and turns of the cyclic stream to attain perfection; passing first through the Saturn period, the scarab -- sacred beetle of the Egyptians -- pointing the way.  It passes through each planet, gaining from each their measure of experience, until at last it reaches the Earth.  

This initiation once passed, note how quickly the earth spirit, having attained perfection, returns to the source and Center of Light. 

It will be noted in this curious spiral that the planetary sequence is the same as the planetary hour system except that Mercury and Venus are transposed in this travel to the Earth.

[rluu: Interestingly, this illustration looks a lot like a treble clef in music.  Maybe they are the same thing!?].

The Jews have their Sabbath on Saturday, the day on which God rested after creating a world.

pg. 14

Saturn, the God of Time, the reaper, old Father Time with his scythe and hour glass, the destroyer, a revenging deity, typified asSatan, the devil, held a powerful influence and a most important place in Jewish theology.

Saturn, or as we use the word, "Satan", was styled the evil one by ancient Astrologers, and the keynote of the religious philosophy thundered from Mt. Sinai, according to Biblical authority, was revengeful, -- an eye for an eye, -- partaking of all the Saturnine attributes.

pg. 14, 15

The first disciples of Jesus were fishermen, most of his ministry was connected with the sea of Galilee, his greatest miracles were associated with water and fishes; he fed the multitude with five barley loaves and two small fishes, the symbol of Pisces and the opposite sign Virgo.  (John 6.9).  According to that old starry legend recorded in the Bible of the sky, the Christ was the Avatar of the water Trigon of the heavens, the religion of the Christ was the religion of baptism, of purification, or peace and non-resistance.  The symbol of baptism is water.
