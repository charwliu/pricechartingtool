'Oedipus Aegypticus' is a massive work of three volumes published in 1642, by Athanacius Kircher.

1 page before pg. 7

This work shows at a glance the probably planetary influence overshadowing may fo the ordinary problems and questions which daily and hourly confront the average person; the best time to commence important undertakings, the "time to sow and the time to reap," both mentally and materially.

pg. 7, 8

We attempt to theorize on the mystic power by which electricity travels unerringly from teh sending station to the telegraph key, almp or level with which it is in tune.  It moves that key, lights that lamp and pulls that lever, while leaving other keys, lamps or levers not in tune, undisturbed, or still greater mystery of the wireless by which the message is flashed to the middle of the ocean without any physical connection between the sending and receiving instruments.  We cannot explain the force we use, -- we can only give it a name and call it electricity or radio activity, -- but its real nature eludes us.  We know that there must be invisible forces in nature of which we are ignorant and by means of which these and many other marvels are accomplished.  Many not each human being be similarly influenced by stellar vibrations? 

pg. 8

Each day given rulership of a planet.  Hours are also given rulership of a planet.  The ancient astrologers found that these planetary hours vibrated to the different planets in the order of their several rates of motion in the zodiac; the first hour after sunrise being ruled by the planet that govrned the day; not equal hours of 60 minutes, but each one twelfth (1/12) part of the time from sunrise to sunset, and the night hours divided in the same manner.  

Order of motion, beginning with the planet of longest period [this is the same order for planetary hours]:
Saturn
Jupiter
Mars
Sun
Venus
Mercury
Moon

pg. 10, 11

Plate II, which is a photo reproduction from 'The Oedipi Aegyptici', a fine old work by Athanacius Kircher, printed in A. D. 1653.  [rluu: It looks like a figure eight, each loop of the eight being a spiral.] He obtained this illustration from a still older manuscript, probably about the 14th century, and it was not original even at that date.  'The Hieroglyph' shows the great way to be traversed by the soul on its progress through the worlds of matter in its search for experience and attainment.  

At the top is shown the spirit or soul starting from the Center of Divine Light on its journey through the world of matter.  The soul having once started on the path, must, with great labor and effort, follow the many twists and turns of the cyclic stream to attain perfection; passing first through the Saturn period, the scarab -- sacred beetle of the Egyptians -- pointing the way.  It passes through each planet, gaining from each their measure of experience, until at last it reaches the Earth.  

This initiation once passed, note how quickly the earth spirit, having attained perfection, returns to the source and Center of Light. 

It will be noted in this curious spiral that the planetary sequence is the same as the planetary hour system except that Mercury and Venus are transposed in this travel to the Earth.

[rluu: Interestingly, this illustration looks a lot like a treble clef in music.  Maybe they are the same thing!?].

pg. 12

Titles of the Sun:
"Ruler"
"Life Giver"
"Lord of the Day"
"Lord's Day"


The Jews have their Sabbath on Saturday, the day on which God rested after creating a world.

pg. 14

Saturn, the God of Time, the reaper, old Father Time with his scythe and hour glass, the destroyer, a revenging deity, typified asSatan, the devil, held a powerful influence and a most important place in Jewish theology.

Saturn, or as we use the word, "Satan", was styled the evil one by ancient Astrologers, and the keynote of the religious philosophy thundered from Mt. Sinai, according to Biblical authority, was revengeful, -- an eye for an eye, -- partaking of all the Saturnine attributes.

[rluu: The author is saying Saturn == Satan].

pg. 14, 15

The first disciples of Jesus were fishermen, most of his ministry was connected with the sea of Galilee, his greatest miracles were associated with water and fishes; he fed the multitude with five barley loaves and two small fishes, the symbol of Pisces and the opposite sign Virgo.  (John 6.9).  According to that old starry legend recorded in the Bible of the sky, the Christ was the Avatar of the water Trigon of the heavens, the religion of the Christ was the religion of baptism, of purification, or peace and non-resistance.  The symbol of baptism is water.

pg. 18, 19

Days of the week are given, with the planet lord.  The latin (and other language) names of the days are given, and also the name of Gods connected to each day.


Tuesday is derived from "Tirsdag", "Tir" or "Tyr", being the name of the Norse God of war, or as the Anglo Saxons had it, "Tiw".  

Wednesday is connected to Woden, or the Norse God Odin, the mighty warrior who invented Runic characters.  Mercury is the Messenger of the Gods, the God of letters.  Odin was the Scandinavian God of Wisdom and poetry, and in a way can be identified with the Greek God Hermes.  

Thursday: Named from Thor, the Scandinavian God of thunder.  Thor was the son of Odin and was described as a vigorous youth with red hair and beard.  The Latins named the day after the thunder God Jove, or Jupiter.  

Friday: Many will not sail on a Friday.
The Boniface banishes Room No. 13 from every hotel in the country.

Columbus is reported to have discovered America on a Friday, and the Bible tells us that it was the day on which Adam was created.  Is it any wonder that he fell, when he had such an unlucky day for a start?

Saturday: Saturn is identified with the Greek God Chronos, the God of time.

pg. 21

Shakespeare said: 
"There is a tide in the affairs of men, which taken at the flood leads on to fortune."

pg. 23, 24

In the early days, astrology was considered sacred -- or secret -- and its secrets were undoubtedly concealed in signs and symbols and in various other ways.

Deck of playing cards contain mysteries, to the mystic they are a fund of occult lore.  Who would dream that this deck of cards concealed a record of mysteries and that it is one of the keys to the riddle of life.  To the Zincali, the Gipsy fortune teller, for instance, the cards contain a fund of occult information.  To the earnest student with a reverent appreciation of the mysticism contained in those cards, the Zincali could reveal much more, for the Tarot or Gipsy's bible, from which our modern playing cards were derived, contains a fund of Astrologic and mystic lore which would prove a revelation.  Much of it known to have been lost, yet the small portion uncovvered reveals that these cards were one of the means by which the old mystics preserved and handed down their occult secrets to posterity.  Our modern cards, direct descendant of the Tarot, are so old that their origin is unknown.  The first book printed ont eh first English printing press, 450 years ago, was a theatise on chess and the playing cards.  


The word "Heiroglyph", for instance, primarily designated the sacred symbols by which the mysteries were concealed and we know that many of those symbols related to the Sun.  The Egyptian and Grecian priests were known as Heirophants or keepers and teachers of the Mysteries.  Heiron was the Egyptian name for a sacred place.  Trace this word still urther back and we find that "Hiru" was the Buddhist name for the Sun, hence the Heirophant, -- the keeper of mysteries, was the minister or priest of the Sun.

pg. 25

The word 'Magician' was once the slang expression for a 'wise man', has now been degraded to symbolize that of a charlatan.  

The word 'Astrology', or Astro-logos, star lore; Astrea was the Roman Goddess of Justice and Logos symbolized the Divine Word, or as Plato has it, "The emanation from the Supreme Mind manifested in speech."

pg. 26

The whole Bible is based upon spiritual manifestation and the AStrologic prophesy.  

pg. 27

The law of love is a scientific verity.  

pg. 28, 29

Illustration from 'The Oedipus Aegypticus' by Athanacius Kircher, A.D. 1653, and taken by him from a mcuh earlier work.  

[rluu: Picture of a guy with horns, holding wind pipes, each pipe connected to a planet, in the same sequence as the planetary hours.]

pg. 30

Sun: The Giver of Life, the Soverign ruler over all, "The Father of Light", the over soul of the world.  The ancients set great importance on the morning air -- the sunrise, as a moral and physical regenerator.  Many claim that there is a peculiar vital quality in teh atmosphere at sun-up; life giving to those physically able to absorb its tonic properties.  It is the only hour in the twenty-four free from maismic mind exhalations, and has been considered in all ages as the best hour for devotional meditation.  Sunrise hour is associated with the planetary ruler of the day.  The Sun and his children (the other planets), each in turn being given the place of honor at the sunrise of their daily namesake.  

pg. 31

A radiometer is so delicate that they claim it will measure and register the heat given off by the most distant planet, equally with that of a candle 500 miles away, or even the light of a firefly, but who can prove that it reacts through interstellar space the same as through our dense atmosphere?

pg. 33

The old philosophers are reputed to have possessed the secret of ever-burning fire, which was lost to the world when it became commercialized.  This may be a myth but even myths sometimes reveal a basic truth.  

pg. 34

Astrological indications for the Sun are given. 

pg. 35

The Moon regulates the tides and the weather.  The Moon has mysterious influence over the mind.  It does regulate the impulses of plant and animal.  The Moon, nearest to Earth, governs all material and sensual things; it undoubtedly has a direct influence over all conception, both physical and mental, for thought has its period of conception, gestation and birth, equally with all other forms of life.  

pg. 36

Ancient men understood fully the vast importance of gathering Herbal remedies in their propert times and seasons.  He found that a remedy gathered under certain phases of the Moon and at propitious times of the year, was a healing balm; gathered at other times, it became a rank poison.  Most of the earlier medical works lay particular stress upon the importance of gathering herbs in season and under proper moon conditions.  

pg. 37

Many farmers know the importance of observing the moon's phases when sowing his seed.  According ot whether the fruit is above or below the ground; inthe light of the moon for the fruits above the Earth, and in the dark of the moon for roots and tubers.  

Experimental tabulation is gradually revealing the fact that the light of the Moon, being a reflected light, is more or less polarized and actually does exercise some mysterious influence over all forms of life.  

Moon: Symbolizes the mother.  Symbolizes grace, idealism, reflection, the maternal and domestic virtues.  Under adverse conditions, uncontrollable, inconsistent, conceited, frivolous, changeable, luny, weak.  

pg. 38.

Mars: The Mars of mythology was the son of Zeus and Juno.  Mars stands for passion, and desire, aggression, self-assertion.  He is pugnacious, rash, hasty, cruel, quarrelsome, tyrannical, audacious, and sensual.  On the higher plane, this martial disposition becomes generous and valiant, filled with courageous activity, constructive and executive ability.  

pg. 39.

Mercury: The swift-winged mssenger of the gods, the flame or light bearer, the thinker, the princely ruler of the rational mind or soul.  He always carried his scepter of authority, the Caduceus -- two serpents curled around a staff and reaching for an eagle.  We moderns have adopted the same device as the emblem of the medical profession.  A very appropriate symbol, for you will remember that Moses set up a golden serpent in the wilderness to cure the Children of Israel when they got stung.  Mercury has been identified as Hermes, who invented the alphabet, according to the Egyptians, and some say that Hermes and Moses were one and the same.  Mercury was always considered by the ancients to possess a very versatile and adaptable but dual nature, with great mental activity and ability, taking the nature of those planets in closest aspect.  

[rluu: The author is saying Mercury == Moses.]

pg. 40, 41

Jupiter: The beneficent god of fortune, was worshipped by the Romans as the Lord of Heaven, the Prince of Light.  He is better known, however, as the god of mammon.  Jupiter was the Roman god of happiness and good fortune, the ancients swore by him "By Jove" and their pet name, "Jove" is still preserved in terms of "jovial," "jolly," indicating supreme good nature.  Jupiter typifies generosity, benevolence, and sincerity.  Jupiter typifies expansion, growth, welath, good fellowship, benevolence, devotion, philosophy, the higher mind.  

pg. 42

Venus: Goddess of love and beauty, godddess of apssion, was known by the Greeks as Aphrodite, by the Phoenecians as Astoreth, byt he Assyrian as Ishtar, byt he Hebrews as Ashtaroth, by the Scandinavians as Freya.  In Hindu mythology, Freya Lakshmi, the wife of Vishnu, was the goddess of matrimony, love and beauty; thus we get the name of our day, Freya's dag, through the Norse or Teuton.  

Venus is represented in mythology as naked, or enveloped in a sea green veil from the foam of the sea and is usually accompanied by white swans and doves, and by her son Amor, or cupid.  

Venus symbolizes the great lvoe nature, with all that the term implies, typical of peace happiness, harmony, affection, imagination, music, art.  Her symbol (Western Venus glyph), the crux ansata, the key of life of the Egyptians.  

Venus is the protector of musicians, embroiderers, perfumers, and all who work in elegant attire, or administer to the luxuries of the great.  She symoblizes the ideal in art, music, poetry, and love in her higher manifestation of life.  

pg. 42

Saturn: Chronos, old Father Time, the watcher on the threshold, Satan, the tempter.  According to mythology, Saturn was the youngest of the Titan Sons of Uranos [rluu: Uranus?] who usurped the throne of his father, but he in turn was afraid that his children would overthrow him, so he devoured all except one, Zeus, who finally conquered him.  Saturn is usually represented in mythology as an old man, who holds a scythe in his right hand and in his left a serpent which is curled in a circle, holding the end of its tail in its mouth.  

Saturn symbolizes limitation, privation, persecution, denial.  They called him Satan, the devil, and yet withal, he was the Guardian, the STrength of the Lord, as they so mystically expressed it.  The reign of Satan was said to have been the golden age of innocence and purity, and yet he was also considered as the monster who devoured his own children.  

Saturn chastises in order that we may learn the lesson.  Favorably situated in teh horoscope, this planet indicates that the individual is steadfast, faithful, prudent, cautious and of good executive ability  Those specially ruled by Saturn are old persons, day laborers, paupers, beggars, farm laborers and especially undertakers, sextons and grav diggers.  

pg. 44

Uranus is generally considered to be the octave of Mercury.
Neptune is generally considered to be the octave of Venus.

Uranus co-ruling Aquarius with Saturn.
Neptune co-ruling Pisces with Jupiter.

pg. 45

Uranus is a Greek God, and is the name used dispite that the original name given to it was Herschel, after its discoverer.  Uranus, in Greek mythology was the God of the air, an eccentric deity from every standpoint.  "Uranus", or "Ouranos" was the personification of heaven.  Ouranos married Gaea or Ge, the Earth, and their children became the Titans, the original creators of man.  See also Gen. 6, 2-4).

Uranus was discovered by Herschel in 1871.

It takes 84 years to make the circle.  Uranus revolves in the opposite direction as the other planets (backwards, just like Venus and Neptune).  

pg. 47

Neptune was discovered in 1846.  The name Neptune was conferred by Johann Franz Enche.  

It takes 164 years to make the circle. Neptune revolves in the opposite direction as the other planets (backwards, just like Venus and Uranus). 

Neptune of mythology was always represented as a very old man, with long flowing beard and a trident or three-pointed spear in his hand, with which he was supposed to shatter rocks and stir up the fiercest storms.  He was identified with Poseidon, which carries us back to the days of Atlantis.  Neptune was the original Old Father Time, a character generally ascribed to his son Saturn.  Neptune has always been considered as God of waters, or of the ocean and inversely the God of inspiration and idealism, influencing those things of a mysterious or hidden nature, the inner spirit.

pg. 55

On certain hours, pressure would be brought to bear along certain negative effects which they must be prepared to meet and guard against.  Bad luck may be transuted by one who knows that certain planetary hours such as Mars or Saturn are malefic and are unfavorable for him to begin any underatking.  He will naturally avoid these hours if he can and choose those ruled by the benefic planets Jupiter, Venus or the Sun.  Select those hours for the consummation of his desires.  

pg. 56

The key to success lies in acting at the right moment, and it has been demonstrated that a knowledge of planetary vibration gives that key, because it measures events by the great dial of time.  

pg. 58 to 75 give the planets and what activities their hours are good for.  The more detailed explanations are on these pages.  

pg. 58, 59

Sun: 

The hours of the Sun are generally benefic, though as a rule, more powerful over matters that are firmly established than over affairs in their infancy.  It is not a good hour to start something new.  It is good for seeking favor from authority figures, for spiritual matters.

Four periods in every month when the Sun is not in a good position for any undertaking: New moon, opposition (full moon), and first and last quarter.  Great care should be taken not to start any new undertaking during a Sun or Moon hour occuring at these periods.  

Solar hours are more potent from July 23 to August 23, when the Sun is in Leo.

Gold is the metal ruled by the sun.  Color ruled by the Sun is orange.  

pg. 60, 61, 62

Moon: 

The hours of the Moon are favorable for all things of a movable nature; to commence voyages, short journeys, especially by water, and for dealings with people whose occupation brings them into contact with travel.  Things of a changeable nature, such as business relating to public conveyances, livery stables, horse traders (but not cattle), all business relating to liquids, milkmen.  All transactions with such people, when considered as favorable should be clinched at once and not left unfinished, or the influence will be lost (have it reduced to writing, as the promises are not realiable, and the persons are uncertain).  Moon deals with the public.  The hours of the moon are godo to cour or marry, though not as good as the hours of Venus.  They are good for domestic affairs, such as washing, and changing things about.  

Moon hours are good in which to hire servants, cultivate the earth.  Choose the light [increasing light] side of the moon for those planets having their fruit above the ground, and the dark side for roots, tubers, etc.

People will change their minds easily during the moon hours.  It is a good hour to make new acquaintances and new friends.  

The hours of the moon are unfavorable for writing or mental labor.  It is a bad time to borrow or lend, or begin anything that you want to have a permanent nature (buildings, etc.).  It is not even a good hour to speculate on the stock market, as the changes are too fluctuating.  

It is a good hour to take medicine and to perform surgical operations for the cure of genital affections and especially female ailments, providng the moon does not occupy the sign ruling the part of the body under operation.  

It is a negative hour and conversation is apt to be about trivial things generally, travel, removal, water, or liquids, and matters of a common or changeable character.  

Four periods in every month when the Moon is not in a good position for any undertaking: New moon, opposition (full moon), and first and last quarter.  Great care should be taken not to start any new undertaking during a Sun or Moon hour occuring at these periods.  

Moon rules the metal: Silver
Moon rules the color: Pale green or pale yellowish white.  

The influence of Moon hours are most potent from June 22 to July 22, and also from new to full Moon each month.  

pg. 62, 63, 64

Mars:

Mars is both constructive and destructive.  The hours of Mars are favorable for those things that require aggressiveness, martial energy and force, and should be selected for transaction of affairs relating to the army or navy, military engineering, or munitions.  Also for dealing with machinists, iron moulders, blacksmiths -- all who work in iron or steel, or use fire largely in their business.  Mars rules iron, steel, sharp instruments, or sharp tactics.  It is a good hour to engage collectors, or start out employees whose business requires aggressiveness.  This hour stimulates energy and gives a firm, bold influence, therefore good for courageous transactions which involve a measure of danger, or in which danger is liable to follow.  

It is not a good hour for dealing with enemies, competitors, or the female sex (because men are most susceptible to indiscretions).  It is a good hour for women to obtain favors from men.  Stay away from dangerous places and dangerous people during this hour.  

Do not start anything of a peaceful nature during the hour of Mars.  A journey started during this time will be susceptible to accidents, assault, slander, thieves, etc.  

While it is a good hour for dealing with surgeons, dentists, and all dealing with sharp instruments, it is a dangerous hour to commence a surgical or dental operation.  Woulds, fevers, and inflammable conditions are more marked at this time.  

Mars rules the metals: iron and steel
Mars rules the color: Red

Martial influences reach their highest potency in April and November (Aries and Scorpio).  

pg. 65, 66, 67

In old mythology, the serpent was always associated with wisdom, but it was the subtle wisdom.

Mercury:

Presides over commerce, wrestling and gymnastic exercises.  Good for everything which requires exercise of eloquence, shrewdness, skill, dexterity, and cunning, plausible diplomacy.  Commerce.  Mental activity, learning, memory.  Communication.  The hours of Mercury ar good to plan and think out ideas, but one must act promptly upon a decision once made, for this is a dualistic, uncertain, changeable hour.  It is an hour when the mind has a clearer perception and gives more ready response to new ideas.  

People are talkative adn easily approached in this hour, but liable to change their minds.  If Mercury is afflicted by square or moon opposition, quarrels, controversies and arguments may arise.  

When mercury is retrograde or when afflicted by the Moon or Saturn, it is unfavorable for business of any nature, and these conditions especially apply in Mercury hours.  

It is a good hour for borrowing or lending short time loads, to start a short journey, to commence the erection of a building, make minor changes of a temporary character.  It is not a good hour to contract marriage, hire servants, buy hourses or lands, or return to a house after a journey. 

Mercury hours are strongest during the months of June and December, and on Sunday.  

Mercury rules the nervous system.  

Mercury rules the metal: quicksilver, the metal that responds quickly to all atmospheric achanges.

Mercury rules the color: Azure and spotted mixtures.

pg. 68, 69

Jupiter:

God of rain storms, thunder and lightning.  The scepter of authority, the thunderbolt of wrath, the eagle, the king of the air.  He was the god of good fortune, hence of money, and it is significant that his symbol -- the eagle -- has from time immemorial been stamped on major coins of nearly all nations at some period in their history.

Jupiter hours are good for any new undertaking, attend to legal, clerical or charitable matters, and for all godo purposes generally.  It is the best hour for dealing with senators, judge,s lawyers, bankers, merchants, clergymen, physicians, men of wealth, officer of life insurance, or fraternal organizations.  It is good for long journeys, for renewing friendships which distance and time has dimmed.  It is a good hour to collect bills, buy, sell, speculate or borrow.  People are inclined to be lenient, generous, benevolent, free and open hearted in this hour.  

The hours of Jupiter strength the vitality and add fertility and resourcefulness.  It is a good hour for clear, sound judgement.  Persons who fall sick during this hour recover quickly.  Conversion during this hour usually is about money matters, traffic, profit, gain, and good fellowship.  

It is not a good hour to buy cattle, enter a ship, or attend to marine affairs, and not good for any transaction of a tricky nature.  

Do not act on any important matters for 15 minutes after the hour commences, nor wait until too near its close, for the hour of Jupiter is preceded by Saturn, and followed by Mars, both of which are baleful.  

Jupiter hours are strongest in December and March, and especially benefic if this planet is the ruler, or well situated in the horoscope.  

Jupiter was named after Thor, the Scandinavian name for Jupiter. 

Jupiter rules the blood, liver, arteries, and thighs.
Jupiter rules the metal: Tin
Jupiter rules the color: Indigo, or light blue.

pg. 70, 71, 72

Venus:

The hours of Venus are good for social affairs, to visit friends, purchase jewelry or other oranments.  It is good to begin a short journey, but not a long one, and especially not a voyage by water.  

The hours of Venus are good to obtain favors from women by either sex, though the hours of Mars are best for women to obtain favors from men.  

It is a good hour to put on a new suit of clothes, engage domestic servants, collect bills, apply for loans, buy stocks, bonds, speculative transactions, get reports on markets, for the prospects are likely to prove more favorable in this hour.  

Everything in this hour is in more pleasant harmony.  Feelings and emotions are more humous, more easily and happily aroused and respond more readily to affection, friendship, sympathy.  It is good for a pleasant social hour with someone.  

Venus rules the skin, throat, kidneys, and internal generative system.  

Venus rules the metal: Copper
Venus rules the color: Blue

Venus is most potent when the Sun is in Taurus or Libra.  

pg. 72, 73, 74, 75

Saturn:

Saturn, Satyr, Satan, the evil one, are synonymous.  He is the devil, with scorpionic tail and pitchfork.  Saturn never robs anyone, but like old Father Time, with scythe and hour glass, surely and inevitably brings all things to a finish.  He is the "Gaurdian of the Threshold", or the balance wheel which regulates the machinery and keepts it at a uniform speed.  

Saturn expresses limitation, and rules over all things requiring labor, effort, endurance, perseverance, and time to accomplish.  It makes one have prudence, and cautious.  He typifies system, organization, constructive and executive ability, the factors which accomplish by tact and method rather than by force.  

Saturn hours are conductive to deep penetration, and subtle reasoning, hence they are good for solving mechanical problems, and those things which require persistence and concentrated thought.  

It is a good hour in which to deal with delinquent employees.  It is a good hour to seek favors from magistrates, jailors, prison or hospital officials, landlords and especially from aged persons.  Saturn hours are favorable for dealing in real estate, mines, minerals, and for engaging common laborers.

It is generally considered a barren, deceitful hour.  Conversations at this hour will be found to gravitate into something melancholy, earthly, gloomy, sickness, death, deceit, old and dirty places, mines and such subjects.

Never take medicine in a Saturn hour, for it will produce harm rather than good.  The cold rays of Saturn keep disease chronic and unrelenting.  Many deaths occur in this hour, especially of elderly people.

It is an unfavorable hour for most general purposes.  

Saturn rules the bones, knees and sense of hearing.
Saturn rules the metal: lead and dross
Saturn rules the color: black and sombre shades

Saturn is more potent when the Sun in Aquarius.  
Persons born with the Sun in Capricorn get the most good out of this planetary hour.  

pg. 78

In order to obtain the full benefit of Planetary hours, particular attention should be paid to the changes of the Moon, i.e., the first and last quarters, full and opposition, as they tend to reverse the ordinary influence exerted during each planetary hour.  

[rluu: Note the author says "tend to", as if it is not a concrete rule.  Could this be the cause of cycle inversions?]

The horoscope of the consultant, of obtainable will also be found to have some influence, especially in the affairs at hand.  For example: If the Sun in the horoscope of the enquirer is badly aspected, it will be unwise to select Sun hours for important undertakings, even though ordinarily benefic.  

pg. 79

The reference tables given for all activities apply except at the changes of the moon, i.e. the first and last quarters, full and opposition, etc., when it is advisible to wait for the benefic hours of Jupiter or Venus if possible, especially in the case of the Sun and Saturn hours.  The horoscope of the inquirer may also affect important cases, according to whether it be in good or reverse aspect.  

The key is given for the reference tables (what each entry and symbol means).

Moon is the reflector.

Each planet, in accordance with its size and mass -- its intrinsic nature, and quality, receives from teh sun its physical as well as its psychic life -- which it absorbs, retains for a period and then returns the current, as though for purification, to the ever-glowing ever-consuming solar fires of Life, Light and Love.

Each planet transmits to each other planet of the system the vibrations of its own quality and life, in the light which it reflects.  This is an important part to thoroughly digest.  Biogenesis is the law, -- life from life only.  

Grasp this Cosmic picture, The Image of God, in whom we move and live and have our being -- in whom man was created (Author says: creation is a state of becmoing, nothing is complete, evolution is creative), as recorded in that beautiful fable of Genesis, "And God created man in his own image," in his own form (Author says: This is the true meaning of image) created he him, "male and female, created he them."

The human counterpart is the microcosm of the Solar macrocosm.

As you sow, you must reap; you cannot escape the harvest of your work adn the most potential harvest is the ultimate fruit of your daily thought; therefore, as you yourself measure to others with whom you deal, so ultimately and surely will things become measured unto you, if not in this world, most certainly in the next, so beware how you act in this life, for upon the farther shore of that other world, you will be powerless to conceal your true motives in life, or to protct yourself from teh harvest of righteous retribution.  

In all psychic matters, like attracts unto itself that which is like, or in common speech, "Birds of a feather flock together."

According to your faith is the power of the mind potent.  Unquestioned belief in your mental power and the idea you wish to impress upon teh person you approach for business or otherwise, will be the measure of your success or failure.  This is the arch keystone of all mental power.  

The Planetary Hours with which we are now going to deal only indicate to you the most favorable time during each day to launch your desire, to put your business proposition or dealings into active operation.  This is the mental key; the Planetary condition of the time is the psychological lock, slowly changing its wards like the time clock of the Banker's safe.  You only have to consult the planetary hour dial to apply this mental key.  

The mere study of Planetary Hours given int eh chart of the preceding work will not always be strong enough to wor, will sometimes fail as often as succeed, without the mental key pushing behind the idea; remember this.  

Often times we have to deal with those who have a stronger mentality than our own.  Our knowledge, adn their ignorance of our system of attack [planetary hours], gives us all the advantage of assured success.  We work with the powers of nature, they may be working against it.  Always provided that we are conscious in our mind of the righteousness of our cause, -- of the right use of that power.

These pages give details about how to select days and hours according to the nature of the situation and the nature of the person.  

pg. 87

If a man is in love and trying to make a proposal to a woman, what natural forces sway these matrimonial emotions and desires?  They are Mars and Venus.  now note, if the lady in question is decidedly feminine in nature, that is to say, gentle, affectionate and domestic in mind and character, choose the day of Venus and the hour of Mars, or the day of Mars and the hour of Venus, for Mars has a powerful influence over Venus and Venus affairs in any aspect.  

But there is another consideration; not all women these days are by any means feminine, affectionate, or domestic; so that if the womman is of strong mind and masculine temperment, then you must alter your tactics.  By choosing the day and hour of Venus, at which time she is more liable to be negative [rluu: polarity?] and receptive, and if this day cannot be selected, choose the day of the Moon and the hour of Venus, but never Mars on a Monday.  If Sunday be your only chance, choose the hour of Venus or the Moon, again, never a Mars hour with a strong-minded woman.  By knowing something of the character of the peopel you are dealing with, you can make a chose of the hour to strike successfully.

For general mercantile affairs, the hour of mercury can be used every day, according to the business of the ruler.  In the business of iron or steel and all martial affairs, you can most successfully use the hour of the Sun when you cannot make Mars convenient.  Always avoid Tuesday for final deals in real estate, unless the buildings thereon are of iron and steel construction.  

Jupiter is the only planet that can be used successfully combined with Saturn.  No other planet will agree with his influx, except in occult matters.  For real estate business: if Saturn should be strong in your horoscope and well aspected by the lord of the second, or the sun and moon, make your election on Thursday in the hour of Saturn or Saturday in the hour of Jupiter.  But if Saturn is unaspected, weak, or badly aspected, leave Saturn alone in earthly things, as you would the plague.  

If your ruling planet (ruler of the rising sign) be strong, nd well placed, choose his day and his hour on suitable days for as many things as you can.  His day is your lucky day, but never use Mars on a Monday, nor the Moon on a Tuesday, nor Mars on a Saturday, or vice versa, nor Saturn on any day except for undertakers or cemeteries and things to do with the dead, unless as before stated, he be especially well placed in your horoscope.

In dealing with important people, choose the day denoting those people, and the hour of the Sun for choice, next the planetary hour rulign the day, and lastly Mercury if you have to.  In dealing with inferior officials, use Mercury every time, after him the hours of the Moon, or you may use the planet ruling the day.

pg. 89

Suppose I wanted to sell some goods or negotiate a loan with a bank.  The most suitable day would be Thursday, in the hour of the same planet -- Jupiter.  But suppose that the president or the official with whom I had to deal was a distinctly martial man, quick, dominant, adn fluent of speech.  I should by no means meet him on a Thursday if I could avoid it, but should select the day and hour of Venus, and get him every time even though Venus has nothign to do with banks and banking.  There is a fine art in this selection.  

The key point here: 
Act [as in choosing the planetary day and hour] in all important affairs as to get on the receptive side of the one you deal with!
