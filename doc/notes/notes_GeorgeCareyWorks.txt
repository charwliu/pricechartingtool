Bible quotes from the Introduction:

"{2:16} And the LORD God commanded the man, saying, Of every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat: {2:17} But of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it: for in the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die." Genesis 2:16-17

"{3:2} And the woman said unto the serpent, We may eat of the fruit of the trees of the garden: {3:3} But of the fruit of the tree which [is] in the midst of the garden, God hath said, Ye shall not eat of it, neither shall ye touch it, lest ye die. " Genesis 3:2-3

"{1:3} And he shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of water, that bringeth forth his fruit in his season; his leaf also shall not wither; and whatsoever he doeth shall prosper." David in Psalms 1:3

"{22:2} In the midst of the street of it, and on either side of the river, [was there] the tree of life, which bare twelve [manner] of fruits, [and] yielded her fruit every month: and the leaves of the tree [were] for the healing of the nations. " John in Revelation 22:2


pg. 7
Blood is the basic material of which the human body is continually builded.  
rluu: Dwight Munson says that our blood is a secondary form of the Earth energy.

As is the blood, so is the body;
as is the body, so is the brain;
as is the brain, so is the quality of thought.
As a man is builded, so thinks he.

pg. 8
The Bible (both the Old and New Testaments) are symbolic writings, based primarily upon the process of body building.  

"Alchemy" really means fleshology.  it is derived from the word "Chem", an ancient Egyptian word meaning flesh.  The word "Egypt" also means flesh, or anatomy.

Alchemy, in a broader sense means the science of solar rays.  

pg. 9
The word "Gold" means solar essence, or solar rays (according to Hebrew cosmology and the Kabala).  Alchemists always referred to solar rays when they used the word "gold".

The transmutation of gold means the process of changing solar rays into all manner of materialized forms, vegetable, mineral, etc.  It is summed up as the changing of spirit into matter.

"Base metals" simply means matter or basic.

According to the Kabala, "M" and "E" figure "B", when united.  
Our English "B" is from the Hebrew Beth, meaning a house or temple (the temple of the soul, or the body).  

The body is really the "Father's House", or the temple of God.

Solomon's temple is an allegory of man's temple -- the human organism.  

pg. 10
The solar (soular) plexus is the great central Sun or dynamo on which the Subconscious Mind (another name for God) operates and causes the concept of individual consciousness.  The brain of man is the "Son of God", the mediator (medium) between the central dynamo and the Cosmic Ocean of Space.  

The Holy Trinity:
God = the solar plexus
The Son = the brain
Holy (whole) Spirit = air (aerial elements, such as blood, inbreathing the breath of life, etc.).

"Your bodies are the temple of the living God"
"The Kingdom of Heaven is within you."

"Elixir of Life"

pg. 11
The nerves are all connected with the brain differently, or by the spinal marrow, but the nerves receive their sustenance from the blood, and their motive power from the solar plexus dynamo.

pg. 12
There is not known in all the realms of architecture or mechanics one little device which is not found in the human organism.  The pulley, the lever, the inclined plane, the hinge, the "universal joint," tubes and trap-doors; the scissors, grind-stone, whip, arch, girders, filters, valves, bellows, pump, camera, and Aeolian harp; and irrigation plant, telegraph and telephone systems -- all these and a hundred other devices which man thinks he has invented, but which have only been telegraphed to the brain from the Solar Plexus (cosmic centre) and crudely copied or manifested on the objective canvas.

pg. 13
Air, or Spirit, breathed into the lungs, enters the arteries (air carriers) and chemically unites with the mineral base, and by a wonderful transformation creates flesh, bone, hair, nails, and all the fluids of the body.

On the rock (Peter or Petra, meaning stone) of the mineral salts is the human structure built.  The minerals in the body do not disintegrate or rot in the grave.

Blood is made from air; thus all nations that dwell on earth are of one blood, for all breathe one air.

pg. 14
"word made flesh"
"breath of life."

"{2:7} And the LORD God formed man [of] the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul." Genesis 2:7

pg. 15
Grief depresses the circulation though the vagus.  The vagus nerve is so named because of its wandering (vagrant) branches.  The roots of the vagus nerve are in the medulla oblongata, at the base of the small brain or cerebelum.  The vagus nerve conducts the mental state to the heart and thus controls the heart action.

The nerves of the human body constitute the "Tree of Life" with its leaves of healing.  The flowing waters of the Rivers of Life are the veins and arteries which sweep the red, magnetic currents of Love -- of Spirit made visible.

pg. 16
The divine telegraph system is the nerve wires.
The Central Sun of the human system is the Solar Plexus -- vibrating life abundantly.

Around this dyanmo of God (the Solar Plexus), you may see the beasts that worship before the throne day and night.  The "Beasts" are the twelve plexuses of nerve centers, telegraph stations, like unto the twelve zodiac signs that join hands in a fraternal circle across the gul of space.

pg. 17
We wonder and adore in the presence of that pulsing orb, th heart.  Tons of the water of life made red by the Chemistry of Love sweep through this central throne every day, and flow on to enrich the Edenic Garden until its waste places shall bloom and blossom as the rose.

pg. 18
The true church of God is the human body.  In this body, or church, spirit operates like some wizard chemist or electrician.

"Day of Judgement": Judgement means understanding, hence the ability to judge.  Man then judges correctly for he sees the Wisdom of Infinite Life in all men, in all things, all events, and all environments.  

pg. 19
When he (man) finds out what he really is, and how much he has always had to do in the making of himself what he is, he will be ready to grasp some idea of the wonderful possibilities of every human soul and body, and will know how completely and entirely is every man his own savior.

Our bodies are completely made over every year, by the throwing off of worn-out cells and the formation of new ones.  Nature will take care of the making-over process, but we are responsible for the plan of reconstruction.  

pg. 24
The Pyramids are encyclopeic of physical science and astral lore.  The science of numbers, weights, measures, geometry, astronomy, astrology, and all the deeper mysteries of the human body and soul are embodied in these incomparable monuments.

pg. 25-26
And when Man is once fully alive to his own heritage, realizing the wonders and possibilities of his own body, and to provide for its needs, eh will assert the divine right within him to be an Ego, a soul, in command of its own templ, and the environments of that temple, and will rejoice in the revaled truth of his own divinity that alone can make him free.

pg. 27
The word "sin" comes from Schin, the 21st letter of the Hebrew alphabet, and means to fall short of completeness or understanding.  In the Tarot symbol, S, or Sin, is represented by the "Blind Fool," one lacking in wisdom.  The ancient Hebrews called the Moon, Sin, because it gave light only part of the time.

pg. 28
There are twelve inorganic mineral cell-salts in the human body, and these minerals (stones in the temple) correspond in vibration to the twelve signs of the zodiac.  

pg. 29-30
Chemical formulae to zodiac divisions:

Aries: From the teachings of Chemistry of Life, we find that the basis of brain or nerve fluid is a certain mineral salt known as potassium phosphate, or Kali Phos.  The Phosphate of Potash.  Synonyms: Potassium Phosphate, Kali Phosphoricum, Potassii Phosphas.  This salt is the great builder of the positive brain cells.  kali phos. unites with albumen and by some subtle alchemy transmutes it and forms gray brain matter.  When the chemical possibilities of this brain builder are fully understood, insane asylums will go out of fashion.  Man has been deficient in understanding because his brain receiver did not vibrate to certain subtle influences; the dynamic cells in the gray matter of nerve were not finely attuned and did not respond -- hence sin, or falling short of understanding.  

pg. 30-31

Taurus: Sulphate of Soda.  Synonyms: Natrum Sulphate, Sodium Sulphuricum, Sodae or Sodii Sulphas, Glauber's Salts.  May be obtained by the action of Sulphuric acid on sodium chloride (common salt).  This cell-salt is found in the intercellular fluids, liver and pancreas.  Its principal work is to regulate the supply of water in the human organism.  The blood becomes overcharged with water, either from the oxidation of organic matter or from inhaling air that contains more aqueous vapor than is required to produce normal blood.  One molecule of nat. sulph. has the power (chemical intelligence) to take up and carry away two molecules, or twice its bulk of water.  So-called malaria, Latin for bad air, is due to a lack of this tissue salt.  

pg. 31

Gemini: The Chloride of Potash, or Potassium.  Synonyms: Potassium chloride, Kali Muriaticum, Kali Chloratum, Kali Chloridum, Potassi Chloridum.  Formula KCl.  This salt must not be confused with the chlorate of potash, a poison, chemical formula KClosub(3).  The cell-salt kali muriaticum (Potassium chloride) is the mineral worker of blood that forms fibrin and properly diffuses it through the tissues of the body.  

pg. 32-33

Cancer: Flouride of Lime.  Synonyms: Calcaria Flurica, Calcium Fluoride.  This salt is formed by the union of lime and fluorine.  Elastic fibre, the chief organic substance in rubber, is formed by a chemical union of the fluoride of lime with albumen, oil, etc.  Therefore, we find this salt dominant in the elastic fibre of the body, in the enamel of teeth and connective tissue.  

There is no such thing as dead or inert.  All is life.  A crystal is an aggregation of living organism.  

Twelve mineral salts of lime, iron, otash, sodium, silica, and magnesium are the foundation stones of every visible form of animal or vegetable.  

pg. 33

Leo: Phosphate of Magnesia.  Synonyms: Magnesium Phosphorica.  This cell-salt may be made by mixing Phosphate of Soda with Sulphate of Magnesia.  This salt is found chiefly in the white fibres of nerves and muscles.  The tissues of nerves and muscles are composed of many very fine threads or strands of different colors, each acting as a special telegraph wire, each one having a certain conductile power or quality, special chemical affinity for certain organic substances, oil or albumen, through and by which the organism is materialized and the process or operations of life are carried on.  

pg. 34-35

Virgo: Sulphate of Potash.  Synonyms: Potassium Sulphate, Kali Sulphos, Potassae Sulphos, Kali Sulphate.  Oil is made by the union of the sulphate of potasium (potash) with albuminoids and aerial elements.  The first element that is disturbed in the organism of those born in the celestial sign Virgo is oil; this break in the function of oils shows a deficiency in potassium sulphate, known in pharmacy as kali sulph.  Virgo is represented in the human body by the stomach and bowels, the laboratory in which food is consumed as fuel to set free the minerals, in order that they may enter the blood through the mucous membrane absorbents.

The letter X in Hebrew is Samech or Stomach.  X or cross means crucifixion, or charge, transmutation.  

pg. 35-36

Libra: Phosphate of Soda.  Synonyms: Natrum Phosphate, Sodium Phosphate, Phosphos Natricus, Sodae Phosphate.  This alkaline cell-salt is made from bone ash or by neutralizing orthophosphoric acid with carbonate of sodium.  Sodium, or natrum, phosphate holds the balance between acids and normal fluids of the body.  

Acid, in alchemical lore, is represented by Satan (Saturn), while sodium hosphate symbolizes Christ (Venus).  An absence of the Christ principle gives license to Satan to run riot in the Holy Temple.  The Advent of Christ drives the thief out with a whip of thongs.  Reference to temple in the figurative language of Bible and New Testament always symbols the human organism.  "Know ye not that your bodies are the Temple of the living God?"

Solomon's temple is an allegory of the physical body of man and woman.  Soul -- of man's temple -- the house, church, Beth or temple made without sound of "saw or hammer."

Hate, envy, criticism, jealousy, competition, selfishness, war, suicide and murder are largely caused by acid conditions of the blood.  Without a proper balance of the alkaline salt, the agent of peace and love, man is fit for "treason, stratagem and spils."

pg. 37

Scorpio: Sulphate of Lime.  Synonyms: Calcium Sulphate, Calcarea Sulphate, Calc Sulphos, Gypsum, Plaster of Paris.  This salt can be obtained by precipitating a solution of chloride of lime with dilute sulphuric acid.  

Sagittarius: The mineral or cell-salt of blood corresponding to Sagittarius is Silica.  Synonyms: Silica, Silic, Oxide, White Pebble or Common Quartz.  This salt is the surgeon of the human organism.  Silica is found in hair, skin, nails, periosteum, the membrane covering and protecting bone, the nerve shealth, called neurilemma, and a trace is found in bone tissue.  The surgical qualities of silica lie in the fact that its particles are sharp cornered.  

The Centaur of mythology is known in the "Circles of Beasts that worship before the Lord (Sun) day and night," as Sagittarius, the Archer, with drawn bow.  Arrow heads are compoased of fiint, decarbonized white pebble or quartz.  Thus we see why silica is the special birth salt of all born in the Sagittarius sign.  

pg. 38

Capricorn: Phosphate of Lime.  Synonyms: Calcerea Phosphoricum, Calcium Phosphate.  Phosphoric acid dropped in lime water precipitates this salt.  Circle means Sacrifice, according to the Kabala, the straight line bending to form a circle.  Thus we find 12 zodiacal signs sacrificing to the sun.  The Kabalistic numerical value of the letters G, O, A, T, add up to 12.

pg. 38-39

Aquarius: Sodium Chloride.  Synonyms: Natrum Muriaticum, Sodii Chloridium, Chloruretum, Chloruretum of Sodicum, Common table salt.  A combination of sodium and chlorine forms the mineral known as commo salt.  This mineral absorbs water.  The circulation or distribution of water in the human organism is due to the chemical action of the molecules of sodium chloride.  

Aquarius is known as "The Water Bearer."  Sodium chloride, known also as natrum muriaticum, is also a bearer of water, and chemically corresponds with the zodiac angle of Aquarius.  

pg. 39-40

Pisces: Phosphate of Iron.  Synonyms: Ferrum Phosphate, Ferri Phosphas.  In cases of fevers and inflammatory symptoms, we find the phosphate of iron molecularly deficient.  Health depends on a proper amount of iron phosphate in the blood, for the molecules of this salt have chemical affinity for oxygen and carry it to all parts of the organism.  Iron is known as the magnetic mineral, due to the fact that it attracts oxygen.  Pisces people possess great magnetic force in their hands and make the best magnetic healers.  

The word 'fever' comes from the Latin word 'fervere', meaning "To boil out."

pg. 41

Elixir of life
Philosopher's Stone
The Mercury of the Sages
"hidden manna"

The rock -- Peter, or Petra -- must be perfectly formed before the etheric wires, which span the gulf between birth forward to the sidereal point of conception can vibrate in such harmony as to sustain the traveller on this "magical bridge of three piers," or the three zodiac signs through which the material body must successfully function before it may hope to lift the veil of Isis.

The Bridge of Life, a symbol of physical regenesis, has been explited in song, drama, and story.  Paracelsus, Pythagoras, Lycurgus, Valentin, Wagner, and a long and unbroken line of the Illuminati have chanted epics in unison with this "riddle of the Sphinx," across the scroll of which is written, "Solve me, or die."

pg. 42

Three Piers of the magical Bridge
The Way of Holiness

pg. 43

The inner eye -- "the eye behind the eye" just above and attached to the pineal gland by delicate electric wires, is called Optic Thalmus, and means "Light, or Eye of the Chamber."

In the Greek, it means "The Light of the World," "The Candlestick," "Wise Virgins," "The Temple Needs no Light of the Sun," "If Thine Eye be Single, Thy Whole Body shall be Full of Light," and other texts in teh New testament refer to the single eye or Optic Thalmus.  

All-Seeing Eye.

Christ Jesus is made to say "I am the Light of the World."  The word "world" comes from "whirl", to turn as a wheel, to gyrate.  

Until we know the meaning of the words "Jesus" and "Christ" we will not understand the bible, which was written in Greek and Hebrew.  

pg. 44

The word for "Jesus" is from Ichtus, Greek for fish.  

The word "Christ" means a substance of oil consistency, an ointment or smear.  Varnish or paints are used to preserve or 'save' wood or paper or cloth -- hence they become Saviors.  

The word "doctor" is from Latin "docere," to teach.

Now read carefully: Every month in the life of every man or woman, when the moon is in the sign that the sun was in at the birth of the individual, there is a psycho-physical seed or "Son of Man" born near the Solar Plexus or the pneumo-gastric plexus which, in the ancient text, was called the "House of Bread," "The Tree of Life," etc.

pg. 45

Bethlehem is from Beth, a house, and helm, bread.  "Cast thy bread upon the waters and it shall return to thee after many days."  Waters are the blood and nerve fluids of the body which carry the fish on its "Divine Journey" to regenerate, save and redeem man.  Nazareth means to cook.  Nazarene means cooked.  Cook means to prepare.  Any materialized thing is bread, Nazareth, mass, maso, or dough.  Thus the Catholic Mass.  Also Maso-n.  It will now be made plain why the Masons and Catholics are not in agreement, for our letter N is an abbreviation of the 14th letter of the Hebrew Alphabet, Nun, a fish.  By adding N to Maso, the riddle of cooked or prepared fish was made so plain that the priesthood strenuously objected, and thus developed friction between the church and Masonry.  

pg. 45-46

The disciples were fishermen.  The early Christians used a fish as their secret symbol.  Money to pay taxes was taken from the mouth of a fish.  Bread and fish were increased until 12 baskets full were left.  God prepared a fish to swallow Jonah.  Jonah means dove.  Dove means peace -- the germ descending from the gray matter of the brain (see baptism of John).  The storm means sex desire.  The life seed was thus saved.  "He that is born of God cannot sin (or fall short of knowledge) for his seed (fish) remaineth in him." -- John.  The age of puberty is about 12.  Up to that age, a child does not understand moral responsibility.  "The first born" means the first seed or fish.  Pharaoh, sex desire, always tries to destroy the first born.  When Jesus was born in Bethlehem, he went (at the age of 12) up the pneumo-gastric nerve, which crosses the medulla oblongata at its junction with the spinal cord at the head of the "River of Jordan," the marrow or nerve fluid of the spinal cord and enters the cerebellum, the temple.  This is the temple where the moral seed argued with the purely animal cells to change their rate of vibration to moral and spiritual concept.  Later this seed (Jesus) drove those who bought and sold ("Even as you and I") with a whip of thongs out of the temple.  We must all give up the animal life or suffer the same fate.  

pg. 46

"Egypt" means the dark lower part of the body.  That part of the body below the Solar Plexus is Egypt, or the Kingdom of Earth.  All above the center, constitutes the Kingdom of Heaven.  

The "Manger" or "Bethlehem", is the center, or the balance. 

"Nile", "Moses" and "Pharaoh's daughter" all refer to generation.  (See overflow of Nile).  It rises in mountains of the moon.  Moses means "drawn from the water."  Fish are drawn from water.  "There are two fishes in our sea" -- Vaughn.  See sign of pisces, two fishes.  

Joshua the Son of Nun.  Nun is Hebrew for fish.  

Moses was the physical or 'generative' fish.  
Moses' laws were on the 'physical' plane.  

pg. 46-47

Joshua's laws were spiritual.  Joshua means "God of Salvation," and salvation comes from saliva or salivation.  Sal is salt which 'Saves'.  Saliva 'saves' the body by digesting (or preparing) the food.  Saliva is a smear or ointment, and so Joshua compares with Christ as Moses compares with Jesus.  

Moses died on Mt. Nebo.  Nebo means understanding.  Joshua took the place left vacant by the death of Moses.  Jesus was baptized 'of' John in Jordan -- the fluids, the Christ substance of the spinal cord, and became, "my beloved Son in whom I am well pleased."  There is no J in the Greke or hebrew alphabets, therefore the word 'john" IOHN meaning "Soul" or "fluids of the body" and not the Ego or Spiritual Man.  So when the body dies, the fluids die -- thus man loses his soul when he loses his body.  To prevent the loss of soul and flesh is the mission of the Son, or Seed, of God, or the Son of man.  

pg. 47

Adi and Pingali are two small nerves that extend up from the Solar plexus, and cross at the base of the brain and unite at the Optic Thalmus, the eye of the chamber.  After the seed or fish has been 'Christed', if it is retained and not wasted in sexual desire, it goes up to "Golgotha," the place of the skull, and crosses the wires, then remains three days in the tomb or the three chambers of the pineal gland, then it enters the Optic Thalmus and "giveth light to all that are in the house."

What or where is the source or origin of this seed or redeeming Son?  
Answer: Ether, Spirit or God.  

Esse, Universal intelligence, or 'It'.  'It' breathes into man the breath of life.  This elixir is carried through lungs into arteries, or air carriers, where it unites with the inorganic cell-salts, materializes (cooked), and forms granules, and is then deposited as flesh and bone.  

pg. 48

Before one can fully realize the power of the Optical Thalmus, the Divine Eye, he must understand the meaning of 'Or', especially in relation to 'Word' and 'Jordan'.

Iordan (not Jordan) is the word in the original text.  I is framed from Iod -- the 10th letter of the Hebrew Alphabet, and means "hand," or that which creates.  

'Or' is gold, not metal, but the 'precious substance' -- the seed.  Dan is Hebrew for Judge, therefore the Creative Power, operating through the precious substance, produces Judgement, or the man of good judgement.  

The upper brain is the reservoir of this 'Or' and is the gray matter or 'Precious Ointment' of Christ.  

"{1:1} In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. {1:2} The same was in the beginning with God. {1:3} All things were made by him; and without him was not any thing made that was made. {1:4} In him was life; and the life was the light of men. {1:5} And the light shineth in darkness; and the darkness comprehended it not." John 1:1-5

The upper brain is the 'Word', and it furnishes all that man contains, or is.  Jesus was not a Savior until he was 'Christed of Iohn in the Jordan'.  Then he became the "Beloved Son."

Why was baptism necessary?  Because there are two fish.  One was Jesus, the Carpenter, the man; the other, the 'Christed' Jesus the Son of God.  The Christ substance gave the electric or magnetic power to the seed to cross the nerves at Golgotha without disintegrating or dying.  

To crucify, means to add or increase a thousand-fold.  When electric wires are crossed, they set on fire all inflammable substances near them.  wehn the Christed seed crossed the nerve at Golgotha, the veil of the temple was rent and there was an earthquake, and the dead came forth, i.e. the generative cells of the body were quickened or regenerated.  

The crucifixion or crossing of the life seed gives power to vibrate the pineal gland at a rate that causes the Optic Thalmus to fill the "whole body with light," and send its vibration out along the optic nerve to the physical eye, and thus heal the blind.  

pg. 49

"Pharaoh" means a ruler or a tyrant or sex desire.  

"Israel" means blood.

"Children of Israel" means molecules of the blood.  

"Galilee" means a circle of water -- the fluids of the body. 

Jesus walking on the water is a symbol of the seed, or fish on its journey.

Peter, from petra (stone) is a symbol of physical or material thought which was rescued by the fish, Savior.  

pg. 50

Optic Thalmus is called "The Lamb of God that taketh away the sins of the world."

pg. 53

The Sun is the "Son of Man".

pg. 54

Solomon's temple is the human temple, or soul of man.

pg. 55

Virgin Mary: Virgin = pure, Mary or mare = water, thus it means pure water or pure sea, ore pure ether or spirit.  Fish come out of the water.  

"Fish" is seed.

pg. 56

"A river went out of Eden to water the garden, and from thence it was parted and became four heads.  The name of the first is Pishon; the second Gihon; the third, Hiddekel; the fourth, Euphrates."
The river is saliva.
Pishon is the urine.
Gihon is the intestinal tract.
Hiddekel is the blood.
Euphrates is the nerve fluids, especially the creative.

Abram and Sara, or Sarai, had the letter H added to their names when the angel appeared to them and gave instructions.  See Gen. 16, 17, and 18.  H is from Heth, the eighth letter of the Hebrew alphabet, and means field or a vision.  The meaning of Heth (H) is given in teh Jewish Kaballa and Tarot card symbols as "Spiritual Perception" -- field, or vision.  

Sara gave birht to Isaac after this regeneration.  Isaac means laughter, a symbol of happiness; so the story is a symbol of physical regeneration.  

Job (or IOB since there is no J in the Hebrew alphabet) figure up, numerically to 19, which means "resplendent light."

Eden - the chamber.  I.e. Regeneration develops the optic thalmus, or single eye, by furnishing the oil necessary to light the chamber or Eden.  

pg. 57

The Bible is a compilation of astronomical, physiological and anatomical symbols, allegories and parables.  


The mineral salts of blood were called sand or salt by Hebrews.  The cell-salts that are found in the pineal gland are chiefly potassium phosphat, the base of the gray matter of hte brain; but all of the 12 inorganic salts are represented. 

pg. 58

"The white stone" - The pineal gland.  This term is used in Revelations.

# Notes on 'The Wonders of the Human Body' by George W. Carey.
##############################################################################

pg. viii [Introduction].

He [Carey] shows that the correct translations of the Greek and Hebrew scriptures plainly state that all the allegories and fables of these works refer to actual physiological facts; and the statements -- [1], [2], [3], can be physiologically and chemically explained.  

Quotes [1], [2], and [3], are from:

[1]:
"Seek ye first the Kingdom of Heaven and all things shall be added unto you"

Closest to a match in a search are:
{6:33} But seek ye first the kingdom of God, and his
righteousness; and all these things shall be added unto you.
{12:31} But rather seek ye the kingdom of God; and all
these things shall be added unto you.

[2]:
"The Kingdom of Heaven is within you"

Closest to a match in a search is:
{17:21} Neither shall they say, Lo here! or, lo there! for,
behold, the kingdom of God is within you.

[3]
"Be ye therefore perfect as your Father in Heaven is perfect" 

Closes to a match in a search is:
{5:48} Be ye therefore perfect, even as
your Father which is in heaven is perfect.


Foreward says that this book is basically an expanded version of 'The Tree Of Life'.  

[Didn't take notes from pages 1-37.  Some of this section is a duplication of 'The Tree Of Life'.].

pg. 38.

The Lord said: "As ice and water are one, and the gases and water are one, so is spirit and matter one.  The different phases and manifestations cognized by man in the molecules of My body -- that is, the universe, -- are caused by the Word; thus, they are My thoughts clothed with form."
  Now the scientist felt bold, being redeemed from fear, and asked "is my blood, then identical with Thy blood in composition and Divine Essence?"  And the Lord said, "yeah, thou are one with the Father."  The scientist now understood and said, "Now mine eyes are opened, and I perceive that when I eat, I partake of Thy body; when I drink, I drink of Thy blood; and when I breathe, I breathe Thy spirit."  So-called matter is Pure Intelligence and nothing else -- because there is not anything else.  

pg. 39.  

This section introduces the word "IT".
