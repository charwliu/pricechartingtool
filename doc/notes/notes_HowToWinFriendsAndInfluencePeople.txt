Part 1: Fundamental techniques in handling people.


pg. 5.

People do not blame themselves for anything.  
Most of them attempt by a form of reasoning, fallacious or logical, to justify their actions.

[Reference to John Wanamaker].

People do not criticize themselves for anything, no matter how wrong it may be.

Criticism is futile because it puts a person on the defense and usually makes him strive to justify himself.  Criticism is dangerous because it wounds a person's precious pride, hurts his sense of importance, and arouses resentment.  

pg. 6

"As much as we thirst for approval, we dread condemnation."
-Hans Selye.

Don't criticize people, they are just what we would be under similar circumstances.  

pg. 14

"I will speak ill of no man and speak all the good I know of everybody."
-Benjamin Franklin.

Any fool can criticize, condemn and complain -- and most fools do.  But it takes character and self-control to be understanding and forgiving.  

"A great man shows his greatness byt he way he treats little men."
-Carlyle.

pg. 17

Principle 1:
Don't criticize, condemn or complain.

"I consider my ability to arouse enthusiasm among my people the greatest asset I possess, and the way to develop the best that is in a person is by appreciation and encouragement."
"There is nothing else that so kills the ambitions of a person as criticisms by superiors.  I never criticize anyone.  I believe in giving a person incentive to work.  So I am anxious to praise and loathe to find fault.  If I like anything, I am hearty in my approbation and lavish in my praise."
-Charles Schwab.

pg. 27

pg. 34

The only way to influence other people is to talk in terms of what the other person wants.

pg. 35

Any time you want someone to do something, first ask yourself:
"How can I make this person want to do it?"

That will stop us from rushing into a situation heedlessly, with futile chatter about our own desires.  

pg. 37

"If there is any one secret to success, it lies in the ability to get the other person's point of view and see things from that person's angle as well as your own."
-Henry Ford.

pg. 43-44
When speaking/selling to others, focus on their wants, not your own.  

If salespeople can show us how their services or merchandise will help us solve our problems, they won't need to sell us.  We'll buy on our own.  Customers like to feel like they are buying -- not being sold.

pg. 45

The world is full of people who are grabbing and self-seeking.  So the rare individual who unselfishly tries to serve others has an enormous advantage.  He has little competition.

Part 2:  Six ways to make people like you.

pg. 55.

You have to be interested in people if you want to be a successful writer of stories.  That is true of dealing with people face-to-face also.  

pg. 56

Mr. Thurston's secret of success.
He had two things that others didn't have.  
First, he had the ability to put his personality across the footlights.  He was a master showman.  He knew human nature.  Everything he did, every gesture, every intonation of his voice, every lifting of an eyebrow had been carefully rehearsed in advance, and his actions were timed to split seconds.  

But in addition to that, Thurston had a genuine interest in people.  Every time he went on stage he said to himself: "I am greateful because these peopel come to see me.  They make it possible for me to make my living in a very agreeable way.  I'm going to give them the very best I possibly can"

He declared that he never stepped in front of the footlights without first saying to himself over and over, "I love my audience.  I love my audien."  

pg. 57.

Uncle George, [age 72], by having a sustained interest in other people, he created a new life for himself at a time when most people consider their productive lives over.

Never forget that to be genuinely intereste in other people is a most important quality for a salesperson to possess -- for any person, for that matter.

If we want to amke friends, let's put ourselves out to do things for other people -- things that require time, energy, unselfishness and thoughtfulness.

pg. 60-61.

Make a point to get and remember birthdays, to assemble a birthday book.  Then send a letter or telegram on the day.  

pg. 61

If we want to make friends, let's greet people with animation and enthusiasm.  When someone calls you on the telephone, use the same psychology.  Say "Hello" in tones that bespeak how pleased you are to have the person call.  

pg. 64.

We are interested in others when they are interestd in us. 

A show of interest, as with every other principle of human relations, must be sincere.  It must pay off not only for the person showing the interest, but for the person receiving the attention.  It is a two-way street -- both parties benefit.  

pg. 65.

Principle 1:
Become genuinely interested in other people.

pg. 74.
Principle 2:
Smile.

pg. 79.

Benton Love, chairman of Texas Commerce Bancshares, believse that the bigger a corporation gets, the colder it becomes.  

"One way to warm it up is to remember people's names.  The executive who tells me he can't remember names is at the same time telling me he can't remember a significant part of his business and is operating on quicksand."


People are proud of their names.  

pg. 80.
Most people don't remmeber names, for the simple resaon that they don't tak eth time and energy necessary to concentrate and repeat and fix names indelibly in their minds.  They make excuses for themselves, they are too busy.

pg. 82
FDR knew that one of the simplest, most obvious and most important ways of gaining good will was by remembering names and mking peopel feel important -- yet how many of us do it?  

THe ability to remember names is almost as important in business and social contacts as it is in politics.  


Napolean the Third, Emperor of France and new hew of the great Napolean boasted he could remember the name of every person he met.  His technique?  Simple.  If he didn't hear the name distinctly, he said "So sorry.  I didn't get the name clearly."  Then if it was an unusual name, he would say, "How is it spelled?".

During the conversation, he took the trouble to repeat the name several times, and tried to associate it in his mind with the person's features, expression and general appearance.  

If the person was someone of importance, Napolean went to even further pains.  As soon as he was alone, he wrote the name down on a piece of paper, looked at it, concentrated on it, fixed it securely in his mind, and then tore up the paper.  In this way, he gained an eye impression of the name as well as an ear impression.  

pg. 83

All this takes time, but "Good manners are made up of petty scrifices." 
- Emerson.  

The name sets the individual apart; it makes him or her unique among all others.  The information we are imparting or the request we are making takes on a special importance when we approach the situation with the name of the individual.  From the waitress to the senior executive, the name will work magic as we deal with others.  

Principle 3:
Remember that a person's nme is to that person the sweetest and most important sound in any language.  


pg. 93

If you aspire to be a good conversationalist, be an attentive listener.  To be interesting, be interested.  Ask questions that other persons will enjoy answering.  Encourage them to talk about themselves and their accomplishments.  

Remember tha thte people you are talking to are a hundred times more interested in themselves and their wants and problems than they are in you and your problems.  

Principle 4:
Be a good listener.  Encourage others to talk about themselves.  

pg. 94

Whenever Roosevelt expected a visitor, he sat up late the night before, reading up on teh subject in which he knew his guest was particularly interested.  

The royal road to a person's heart is to talk about the things he or she treasures most.  

pg. 98

Principle 5:
Talk in terms of the other person's interests.
