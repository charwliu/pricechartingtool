Notes on W.D. Gann's Master Stock Market Course.


rluu: The notes below are not complete.  I stopped taking notes because the style of writing and describing by Gann is not very conductive to note-taking.  There are lots of dates and data that is given such that it would be akin to almost typing exactly what he wrote.  I think it might be better to make my hand-written notes inline in the Master Courses, and put Post-It Notes as tabs for the important pieces of information.

Chapter 1: Speculation A Profitable Profession
           A Course Of Instruction On Stocks

pg. 6

There are many rules in my book "45 Years In Wall Street" which are not in this course of instruction.  

pg. 9

If you have taken my Master Forecasting Course, apply the rules on "Great Time Cycles" as well as the minor time periods.  ["Great Time Cycles" is mentioned.]


Stop losses should be placed below closing prices on the daily, weekly, or monthly chart.  


Time periods to chart:
  - Daily
  - Weekly
  - Monthly
  - Yearliy

pg. 10

Remember thegreater the time period, when it is exceeded, the greater the move up or down.  

pg. 21

If you will go over any active stock over a period of 5, 10, or 20 years, and note all the moves of 10 points or more, you will see that there is more profit for trading these swings than there is trading for dividends or holding for big increase in capital.

pg. 24

Of course, the day will come when the "great time cycle" indicates a great depression, that large and small investors will lose confidence and sell the blue chips when they are at very low levels. 

pg. 25

Chart of the "Dollar Trend", which is a chart of the total value in dollars of the stocks of a certain industry listed on the Exchange.  

[rluu:  I think this is the chart of market capital of each stock.  And then the market capital chart of a industry.]

[rluu: There is a chart in the back that has the chart of the sum of the market value of all stocks on the NYSE.  He has a chart for the yearly swings and the monthly swings of this.  ]

pg. 28

Gann says, "I am nearing my 76th birthday and I have realized happiness and success."  

[rluu: 
  19 * 4 = 76
  38 * 2 = 76
