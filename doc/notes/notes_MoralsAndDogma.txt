pg. 5

Perfect Ashlar: a stone as taken from the quarry, in its rude and natural state. This is the people, as a mass, rude and unorganized.

Perfect Ashlar: a stone made ready by the hands of the workmen, to be adjusted by the working tools of the Fellow-Craft.  This is a cubical stone, symbol of perfect.  


pg. 6

Will is a force.  Thought is a force.  Prayer is a force.
Two great forces: Faith and Love.

The effects produced, when our hand, moved by our will, launches a pebble into the ocean, never cease; and every uttered word is registered for eternity upon the invisible air. 

pg. 7

The arrangement of the Temple of Solomon, the symbolic ornaments which formed its chief decorations, and the dress of the High-Priest, all had reference to the order of the Universe, as then understood.  The Temple contained many emblems of the seasons - the sun, the moon, the planets, the constellations Ursa Major and Minor, the zodiac, the elements, and other parts of the world.  



The Lodge is said to be supported by three great columns:
  - Wisdom
  - Force or Strength
  - Beauty

pg. 8

Wisdom, Power, and Harmony constitute one Masonic triad.  

pg. 8-9

About Jachin and Boaz:

The two columns, which stood in the porch of the Temple on each side of the great eastern gateway.  

Account from Books 1 Kings, and 2 Kings, confirmed in Jeremiah:
  - Pillars were bronze.
  - 4 fingers breadth in thickness.
  - pillars were 18 cubits high (over 30 ft 8 in)
  - with a capital 5 cubits in height (a little over 8 ft 6 in)
  - diameter of the shaft 6 ft 10 in.  
  - capitals were enriched by pomegranates of bronze, covered by bronze net-work and ornamented with wreaths of bronze
  - appear to have imitated the shape of the seed-vessel of the lotus or Egyptian lily, a sacred symbol to the Hindus and Egyptians.  


1 cubit == 1.707 feet.



Jachin: The pillar or column to the right.  The Hebrew word means, "He shall establish".  [Hebrew word given].  It was probably pronounced 'Ya-kayan', and meant, as a verbal noun, "He that strengthens"; and thence, "firm, stable, upright".  This word also means "he will establish", or "plant in an erect position".  It probably meant 'Active' and 'Vivifying Energy' and 'Force'.  

Boaz: The pillar or column to the left.  The Hebrew word means, "In it is strength".  [Hebrew word given].  The last two hebrew letters of the word means Strong, Strength, Power, Might, Refuge, Source of Strength, a Fort.  The first letter, prefixed, means "with" or "in", and gives the word the force of the Latin gerund, 'roborando', -- "Strengthening".  Boaz probably meant 'Stability', 'Permanence', in the passive sense.  


pg. 10

The ancients counted 7 planets thus arranged: 
  - Moon
  - Mercury
  - Venus
  - Sun
  - Mars
  - Jupiter
  - Saturn

There were 7 heavens, and 7 spheres of these planets.

On all the moments of Mithras are 7 altars or pyres, consecrated to the 7 planets, as were the 7 lamps of the golden candelabrum in the Temple.  That these represented the planets, we are assured by Clemens of Alexandria, in his Stromata, adn by Philo Judaeus.  

To return to its source in the Infinite, the human soul, the hancients held, had to ascend, as it had descended, through the 7 spheres.  The 'Ladder', by which it reascends, has, according to Marsilius Ficinus, in his Commentary on the Ennead of Plotinus, 7 degrees or steps; and in the Mysteries of mithras, carried to Rome under the Emporers, the ladder, with its 7 rounds, was a symbol referring to this ascent through the spheres of the 7 planets.  

jacob saw the Spirits of God ascending and descending on it; and above it the Deity Himself.  The Mithraic Mysteries were celebrated inc aves, where gates were marked at the four equinoctial and solstitial points of the zodiac; adn the 7 planetary spheres were represented, which souls needs must travese in descending from the heaven of the fixed stars to the elements that envelop the earth; and the 7 gates were marked, one for each planet, through which they pass, in descending or returning.

The "Great Lights in Masonry", and also the "Furniture of the Lodge":
  - Holy Bible
  - Square
  - Compasses

pg. 13

The Master of Light and Life, the Sun and the Moon, are symbolized in every Lodge by the Master and Wardens: and this makes it the duty of the Master to dispnse light to the Brethren, by himself, and through the Wardens, who are his ministers.

Temple of Eleusis: A sanctuary lighted only by a window in the roof, and representing the Universe.  in this Temple of Eleusis, the images of the Sun, Moon, and Mercury, were represented.  

pg. 13-14

The Sun and Moon represent the two grand principles of all generations, the active and passive, the male and the female.  The Sun represents the actual light.  He pours upon the Moon his fecundating rays; both shed their light upon their offspring, the Blazing Star, or Horus, and the three form the great Equilateral Triangle, in the center of which is the omnific letter of the Kabalah, by which created is said to have been effected.  

pg. 14

Ornaments of the Lodge are said to be:
  - Mosaic Pavement
  - The Indented Tessel
  - The Blazing Star


"There was no stone seen" within the Temple.

The walls were covered with planks of cedar, and 
the floor was  covered with planks of fir.  

pg. 15

Originally the blazing star of five points represented Sirius, or the Dog-star, the forerunner of the inundation of the Nile; the God Anubis, companion of Isis in her search for the body of Osiris, her brother and husband.  It became the sacred and potent sign or character of the Magi, the Pentalpha, and is the significant emblem of Libery and Freedom, blazing with a steady radiance amid the welter elements of good and evil of Revolutions, and promising serene skies and fertile seasons to the nations, after the storms of change and tumult.  


In the Est of the Lodge, over the Master, inclosed in a trinagle, is the Hebrew letter Yod.  In English and American Lodges, the letter "G' is substituted for this, as the initial of the word God, with as letter reason as if the letter D, the initial of Dieu, were used in French Lodges instead of the proper letter Yod.

Yod is, in the Kabalah the symbol of Unity, of the Supreme Deity, the first letter of the Holy Name, and also a symbol of the Great Kabalistic Triads.  To understand its mystic meanings, you must open the pages of the Zohar and Siphra de Zeniutha, and other kabalistic books, adn ponder deeply on their meaning.  It must suffice to say, that it is the Creative Energy of the Deity, is represented as a point, and that point in the center of the Circle of immensity.  It is to us in this Degree, the symbol of that unmanifested Deity, the Absolute, who has no name.  

Our French Brethren place this letter Yod in the center of the Blazing Star.  And in the old Lectures, our ancient English Brethren said, "The Blazing Star or Glory in the center refers us to that grand luminary, the Sun, which enlightens the earth, and by its genial influence dispenses blessings to mankind."  The called it also in the same lectures, an emblem of Prudence, which means Foresight.  Accordingly, the Blazing Star has been regarded an emblem of Omniscience, or the All-seeing Eye, which to the Egyptian Initiates was the emblem of Osiris, the Creator.  With the yod int eh center, it has the kabalistic meaning of the Divine Energy, manifested as Light, creating the Universe.

pg. 16

The Jewels of the Lodge are said to be six in number:
  Three Moveable Jewels (they pass from one Brother to another):
    - The Square
    - The Level
    - The Plumb
  Three Immovable Jewels:
    - The Rough Ashlar
    - The Perfect Ashlar, or Cubical Stone, or in some Rituals, the Double Cube.
    - The Tracing-Board, or Trestle-Board.


It is said by some, that the point within the circle represents God in the center of the Universe.  It is a common Egyptian sign for hte Sun and Osiris, and is still used as the astronomical sign of the great luminary.  In Kabalah, the point is yod, the Creative Energy of God, the universal Light, left vacant, wherein to create the worlds, by withdrawing His substance of Light back on all sides from one point.  

pg. 17

The adept may find the meaning of Jachin and Boaz in the Kabalah.

pg. 19

We see so short a way along the arc of the great circle!  Few minds comprehend the Divine tongue.

pg. 21

Truth is a Divine attribute and the foundation of very virtue.  To be true, and to seek to find and learn the Truth, are the great objects of every good Mason.  

As the Ancients did, Masonry styles Temperance, Fortitude, Prudence, and Justice, as the four cardinal virtues.

II. The fellow-craft.


The Onion was sacred to the Egyptians, because its different layers were a symbol of the concentric heavenly spheres. 


pg. 25

The first Scriptures for the human race werewritten by God on the Earth and Heavens.  The reading fo these Scriptures is Science.  

The purpose of Education and Science is to make a man wise.  If knowledge does not make him so, it is wasted, like water poured on the sands.

[rluu: Gann notes that it is also important to be able to put knowledge into action.]

pg. 34

With the Compasses and Sacle, we can trace all the figures used in the mathematics of the planes, or in what are called Geometry and Trigonometry.  


The Science of Numbers:
  - Pythagoras attached so much importance to this.

  - Mysteries are found everywhere in the ancient religions, and most of all in the Kabalah and the in the Bible.
  
  - Includes: 
     - Geometry
     - Trigonometry
     - Arithmetic
     - Algebra
     - Logarithms
     - Integral and Differential Calculus

The Science of Numbers is worked out in the great problems of Astronomy or the Laws of the Stars.  

pg. 37

When Solon was asked if had given his countryment hte best laws, he answered, "The best they are capable of receiving."  This is one of the profoundest utterances on record, and yet like all great truths, so simple as to be rarely comprehended.  It contains the whole philosophy of History.  It means this, that all truths are Truths of the Period, and not truths for eternity; that whatever great fact has had strength and vitality enough to make itself real, whether of religion, morals, government, or of whatever else, and to find place in this world, has been a truth for the time, and as good as men were capable of receiving.

pg. 43

A single thought sometimes suffices to overturn a dynasty.  

Remember, that though life is short, Thought and the influences of what we do or say, are immortal.  

The power of a free people is often at the disposal of a single and seemingly an unimportant individual.  

pg. 49

Masonry in France, gave, as its secret the words, "Equality" and "Liberty", leaving it for every honest and religious Mason to explain them as would best suit his principles, but retained the priviledge of unveiling in the higher Degrees the meaning of those words.

pg. 53-54

The Sword is also, in the Bible, an emblem of Speech, or of the utterance of thought.  Thus, in that vision or apocalypse of the sublime exile of Patmos, a protest in the name of the ideal, overwhelming the real world, a tremendous satire uttered in the name of Religion and Liberty, and with its fiery reverberations smiting the throne of the Caesars, a sharp two-edged sword comes out of the mouth fo the Semblance of the Son of Man, encircled by the seven golden candlesticks, and holding in his right hand seven stars.  "The Lord," says Isaiah, "hath made my mouth like a sharp sword."  "I have slain them," says Hosea, "by the words of my mouth,"  "The word of God," says the write of the apostolic letter to the Hebrews, "is quick and powerful, and sharper than any two-edged sword, piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit."  "The sword of the Spirit which is the Word of God," says Paul, writing to the Christians at Ephesus.  "I will fight against them with the sword of my mouth," it is said in the Apocalypse, to the angel of the chruch at Pergamos.  

pg. 57

The Sword is also the symbol of war and of the soldier.


On numbers:

Two:

Two, or the Duad, is the symbol of:
  - Antagonism
  - Good and Evil
  - Light and Darkness.
  - Cain and Abel
  - Eve and lilith
  - Jachin and Boaz
  - Ormuzd and Ahriman
  - Osiris and Typhon


Three:

Three, or the Triad, is most significantly expressed by equilateral and right-angled triangles.  There are three principal colors or rays in the rainbow (green, yellow and red), which by intermixture make seven.  The Trinity of Deity, in one mode or other, has been an article in all creeds.  He creates preserves, and destroys.  He is the generative power, the productive capacity, and the result.  

According to the Kabalah, the immaterial man is composed of:
  - 'vitality', or 'life', the breath of life.
  - 'soul' or 'mind'
  - 'spirit'

Salt, sulphur, and mercury are the great symbols of the alchemists.  To them, man was body, soul and spirit.


pg. 57-58

Four:
Four is expressed by the square, or four-sided right-angled figure.  
Four in the Bible:

  - Out of the symbolic Garden of Eden flowed a river, dividing into 4 streams:

    "And these were the four winds of the heavens, that go forth from standing before the Lord of all the earth."

  - Ezekiel saw the 4 living creatures, each with 4 faces and 4 wings:

  - Saint John beheld the 4 beasts, full of eyes before and behind:
   - The Lion
   - The young Ox.
   - The Man
   - The flying Eagle.

  - 'Four' was the signature of the Earth
  - Therefore, in the 148th Psalm, of those who must praise the Lord on the land, there are 'four' times 'four', and 'four' in particular of living creatures.  

  - Visible nature is described as the 4 quarters of the world, and the 4 corners of the earth.

  - Old Jewish saying: "There are 4 which take the first place in this world:
    - Man among the creatures
    - The eagle among the birds
    - The ox among the cattle
    - The lion among wild beasts."

  - Daniel saw 4 great beasts come up from the sea.

pg. 58

Five:  
Five is th Duad added to the Triad.  It is expressed by the 5-pointed or blazing star, the mysterious Pentalpha of Pythagoras.  It is indissolubly connected with the number 7.  

Christ fed His disciples with the multitude of 5 loaves and 2 fishes, and of the fragments there remained 12, that is, 5 and 7, baskets full.  Again He fed them with 7 leaves and a few little fishes, and there remained 7 baskets full.  The 5 apparently small planets (Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn), with the 2 greater planets (Sun and Moon), constituted the 7 celestial spheres.

III. The Master.

All religious expression is symbolism.  

The very word 'spirit' means 'breath', from the Latin verb 'spiro', 'breathe'.  

pg. 53

The most abstract expression for Deity, which language can supply, is but a 'sign' or 'symbol' for an object beyond our comprehension.
