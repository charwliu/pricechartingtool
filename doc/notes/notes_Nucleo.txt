Taking someone who has the basic understanding of astro, and start working with those concepts in a market-based situation.

We are going to walk through 'Handbook of Trend Determination', by George Bayer.

Intro.

This video is for new to intermediate WITS members. 

BA's silver of choice is Silver.

BA has been helping traders since 1998.
BA has been trading since 1995.

We want to emulate the successful traders.

You have to get yourself an astrolonomy background.

This is a commit to this field for your own success in this field.  You have to put in the time and effort in order to succeed.  


Intro BA has written:
Many come into this field because W.D. Gann's trading record.  W.D. Gann put his system in the book, TTTA.  It is written in a vieled language.  

One needs to know astrolonomy in order to decode that book.  It is a fusion of astrology and astronomy.  Gann used this.

WITS has many tools to obtain the proper background.

Nucleo is to get you that background.

Since TTTA is cryptic, it's best to start with 'Handbook of Trend Determination' by George Bayer.  George Bayer used the same tools.  While Gann put them all in one book (TTTA), Bayer spreads them all out throughout his works.  

BA is walking us through how to do 'Handbook of Trend Determination', written in 1940.

Rules section (part 2, page 9):

Rule 1:
Speed of Mercury in geocentric longitude.
Extreme speed of Mercury is 2 deg 12'; sometimes the extreme speed is 2 deg 4'.


You would go to the market and see what Bayer was talking about at that time (for those dates).  If you don't have the data for those dates, you can still check the rule with current data.

Rule 2:
Mars Mercury speed differential of 59 minutes.


##############################################################################
Nucleo 2
##############################################################################

Rule 3:
Mars-Mercury longitude difference of 161 deg 32' 18".

Rule 4:
Mercury retrograde position of one year and its effect a year later on the same date.  

Rule 5:
Mercury's retrograde position and its zodiacal value at that time compared to the same mercury position a year ago.

Rule 6:
Mars in geocentric longitude plus 330 degrees.

Time factor is 330 here.

BA: This is not a magical trading tool.  What he is doing is he is referencing something, an idea, from another area.  Any time factor that you have over 180 (degrees), it will be going backwards every time it repeats (in the zodiac).  

Rule 7:
The effect of perihelium of Mars and Venus.

Aphelium == "afar"

For the perihelium and aphelium, Google the values.

Rule 8:
The effect of perihelium by using heliocentric positions.

BA knows people who use this in their trading, but he is unaware of Gann using it in TTTA. 

Rule 9:
Mercury geocentric passing over 19 deg 36' Scorpio and Sagittarius, also over 24 deg 14' Capricorn produces big changes.  

He mentions the oppositing places also bring changes.


Rule 10:
Heliocentric latitude of Saturn units of 1 deg 21".2

BA:  Back then (1940), you had to be extremely precise to making these calculations.  He is testing the limits of people's abilities here.  Latitude of Saturn to the .2 of a minute?  Really?  

BA:  It brings up a point.  Why are we testing these things?  It's because Gann in TTTA has certain elements that tie into this book.  BA is trying to give clues and hints here.  If you don't know background astronomy, then you can't decode TTTA.

Rule 11:
The 6 inch ellipse and its use.

BA: Any form of geometry (ellipse or Gann angle) is useless without the cycles.
BA; We are skipping rule 11.

Rule: 12: Geometry again, so we'll skip that, since it's outside our scope.

Bayer: Whenever you read a book, note that the following pages are of the greatest importance: 
page 40-42
page 70-72
page 80-82
page 123
page 144

BA: The gist of the story is lying in these pages.

To get better explanations of certain pages, I merely went 100 pages further and obtained much clarification of the page one hundred pages before.  

BA: It's actually 104 pages, not 100.


rluu: Make note about the number of pages spoken about on pg. 18 of Handbook of Trend Determination.
rluu: Start taking notes here from 4:26 of Nucleo 3.

Rule 13: Neptune and its true distance from the Earth.

BA: Gann did not use logrithms or distances in TTTA, to BA's knowledge.  BA does not use logorithms in the markets.  

Rule 14: Venus movements in geocentric longitude using a unit of 1 deg 9' 13". 

BA: Venus moves this distance in about a day.  So what's going on here?  That kind of precision with seconds is insane... come on.


1 time: 1 deg 9' 13"
5 times: 6 deg 55' 18"
25 times: 34 deg 36' 30"

BA: A lot of what he's doing is he's trying to throw you off.  There's a reason why he's doing that in this book.


BA: In the financial markets there is no set static... on what he's doing here.

Rule 15:
Venus heliocentric latitude at extreme and least speeds.

BA: Bayer is using Venus latitudes: min, max, and 0 north and 0 south.

BA: Gann does have something very similar in TTTA.  Bayer has skewed it off a little bit here.  Venus latitude is important.  (That is also true in TTTA that latitude is important).

Rule 16: 80 years cycle.

BA: 80 years for time cycles?  No.  You don't have to have 80 years of data.  For many things you don't have 80 years of data.  The repeats aren't 80 years.  What Bayer is saying is there ARE repeats in time.  

Rule 17: Mercury geocentric at 15 Aquarius and 15 Leo and the passage of all others over these points. 

Rule 18: Venus at 15 Aquarius geocentric, using ellipse.  

BA: We're not going to get into this, since it deals with geometry.

Rule: 19
Venus in geocentric position passing the conjunction of the Sun geocentric.
(Venus going direct, and 1 deg 43' 50.7" in front of the Sun.).

##############################################################################
Nucleo 4
##############################################################################

Rule 20: Mercury passing 17 deg 18' 27" Cancer geocentric (more details in the text).


BA covering an important principle: If you go to Venus heliocentric, one year of Venus is roughly 224 days.  Five years of Venus is roughly 1120 days.  To find out how much Earth time it is, you divide by 365.24.  So there are 5 Venus periods in a little over 3 Earth years.  So in the Gann field, a year can mean anything.  It can mean 88 days.  It can mean 224 days in the case of Venus.  And you can take this principle and expand it.  It is a very important principle.  


Rule 21:
Venus in retrograde motion making a conjunction with Mercury.
Move lasts 5 to 8 days.


BA:  Bayer mentions "consult the ellipse with this rule."  Is he trying to give a clue that the ellipse is anchored at the conjunction?  This is what you have to start thinking about, these types of concepts.  That's something to think about and explore here.  

BA:  When you test any of these rules, you will want many more test points (a long period of time).  Bayer only gives you like 3 dates.  You'll want at least 20 test points or so.


Rule 22:
Mercury retrograde passes over the Sun.

BA: If wheat is not your market.  How would you approach it?  You would take a high or low, and see if any of these Bayer rules occured there.  And if you found that, then you would look to see if it was a good rule for that entity.  That's all there is to it.  You need to remember also to be aware of polarity (if Bayer says a top will happen, and your market has been going down, then obviously it won't be a top).  

Rule 23:
One fifth of a second differential in motion of Saturn heliocentric latitude produces tops and bottoms of important.

BA: 1/5th of a section?  No, Gann in TTTA doesn't do anything like that, to BA's knowledge.  Nor does any other good Gann traders he knows.  

Rule 24:
Wheat versus man.

BA: This section talks about Bayer philosophy.  I will tell you that many people use the circle of 24 for wheat.  It's perhaps not coincidence that Bayer uses rule 24 to talk about Bayer philosphy.

Rule 25:
The rule of 4 3/8, 8 3/4, 17 1/2 and 35.  
Covered also in "Time Factors" (for stocks).

Rule 26:
Gaps

Rule 27:
Mercury speed in longitude geocentric of 59' and 1 deg 58'.
(These are mean motions of the Sun and double that).

BA: Mercury rules the brains/thinking, communication.

BA: If you get multiple consective dates for the hit, then take the middle date.

Rule 28:
Saturn heliocentric latitude unit 5' 46.15"

BA: Uhh.. no.  We're not going to get into this, because again here we have complicated calculations.  I'm not saying that latitude isn't important, but the way it does it here, it could be confusion.  Do I use that, or any form of that?  No.

Rule 29:
Movements of Saturn in heliocentric longitude of 34'36.9".

BA: For the dates given, this looks like a cycle, but it's not.  

BA: I don't use this rule and I don't know anyone who does.

Rule 30:
Venus declination passing the extreme declination of the Sun, 23 deg 26' 51".
Causes change of trend.

BA: Whenever a planet exceeds 23 deg 27', it is called "Out of Bounds", or OOB.


Rule 31:
Venus declination making an extreme declination beyond 23 deg 26' 51".

BA:  Basically he is saying to use the maximums when the maximums are Out Of Bounds (OOB).

Rule 32:
Mercury's geocentric longitude 126 deg 30' after the Sun (at the point at a important top or bottom).

BA:  What is he saying here?  This is one of his best rules and he lays it aside and just forgets about it!  What is he doing?  What he's alluding to is that this book is a little different from other books.  So you can't read it through like a general scholar would (modern day academia).  There are some real gems in this, and so much of it is very very close to what is really going on.  In fact, one of the parts that we're not covering in the beginning... he basically just gives it away.  It is a very brilliantly written book.  What he's doing is writing this book for people who want to do his forecasts.  It's a great book to allow you to sink your teeth into it.  What he's actually doing here in this part of the text, he's starting you off down a path.  How to take these rules and start to look at financial markets.  So we can start to look at things based on our astrolonomy background.  

BA:  Here in the text, he is talking about the importance of having an idea about duration.  The cycles will tell you that.  The serious Gann analyst will be looking for the time of the move.

Rule 33:
Mars in geocentric longitude passing 16 deg 55' 46".

Rule 34:
Venus daily variation of heliocentric longitude plus or minus 7 seconds.

BA: Okay Bayer... yeah, we're not going to do this.

Rule 35:
Venus in its extreme speeds in daily variation of heliocentric longitude.
(Heliocentric Venus speeds min and max).

BA: Why did Bayer do this to us?  The planet has differences in speeds due to the elliptic orbit, but the difference is very minute.

Rule 36: Sun-Mercury conjunctions plus 60 deg in geocentric positions.
Four steps:
1) Locate conjunction of Sun-Mercury
2) Project Mercury 60 deg beyond this conjunction.
3) Use Venus from the latter place and project also 60 deg.
4) Continue with Venus by projecting it an extra 12 deg.

Rule 37: Sun-Venus conjunctions plus 60 deg.
Four steps:
1) Locate conjunction of Sun-Venus
2) Project Venus 60 deg beyond this conjunction.
3) Use Mercury from the latter place and project also 60 deg.
4) Continue with Mercury by projecting it an extra 12 deg.

BA: Bayer is doing a roundabout thing.  

Rule 38: Mercury latitude heliocentric.
Change in trend when Mercury passes:
0, 3 deg 21, 6 deg 42, 7 deg 0.



Rule 39: Logorithms of Venus Heliocentric radius vector.
BA: BA says he does not use logorithms.

Rule 40: 
Venus Heliocentric Latitude divided into parts. 

Rule 41:
Mercury's daily speed in geocentric longitude.
(Bad for wheat when speed of Mercury zigzags when speed is above 59' per day).


BA: Regarding 144, there's a specific reason for that number.  It's not just a random square.  There's a reason why you use it.  And you only use it in some markets, because it ties into something else.  


Rule 42:
Venus reduction to orbit.  Value + 2 deg 42'.

BA: I'm not going to worry about this, because Solar Fire does not do it.  And traders don't really use it.  

Rule 43:
Venus heliocentric latitudes 0 deg, 2 deg 16', and 3 deg 32'.

Rule 44:
Mercury halfway retrograde place.


##############################################################################

Rule 45:
Price Levels of Wheat established with logorithms of the planets true distance from Earth.

BA: BA does not do this.  You can do it on your own if you want and see where that takes you.  My understanding is the price a little different from what he gives you. 

Rule 46:
Venus Reduction to Orbit: 0 deg, 1 deg 50', 3 deg 1'.

BA: We're not going to do any Reduction to Orbit.

Rule 47:
Mercury Reduction to orbit of previous year using extreme value of 12' 52".

BA: We're not going to do any Reduction to Orbit.

Rule 48:
Jupiter in right ascension, differential of 1h 21m 45s.

BA: I'm not going to do this, but I'm going to tell you about RA and Declination, and longitude and latitude.  


Longitude and latitude uses the ecliptic system.
RA and declination uses the equatoral system.

It is important to know the difference between the two systems.  

BA:  The bulk of W.D. Gann book TTTA is written under the ecliptic system.

Part 3, rules for Hides.
Rule 1a: Venus daily variation of logarithm radius vector.

BA:  No, we're not going to this.

Rule 2a:
Venus latitude hleiocentric 4 deg 58' (4 deg 52') differences.

Bayer's low: Dec 30, 1937:  0 deg 11
Max reached: Feb 23, 1937:  3 deg 24
Distanced traveled:         3 deg 13
George Bayer "Turn Factor": 4 deg 58
Distanced needed to go, byond the Feb 23, 1937 max: 1 deg 45

Max reached on Feb 23, which needs 1 deg 45 subtracted from it for final answer: 3 deg 24

Venus latitude hit off of Bayer's Rule: 1 deg 39


BA: This kind of calculation is good practice for you.

Rule 3a:
Mercury conjunction to Saturn and Jupiter of 80 years ago.

Rule 4a:
Mercury 80 years ago.

Rule 5a:
Mercury half-way position between retrograde and direct.

Rule 6a:
Mars declination heliocentric 19 deg 51' 00".

BA:  All he's doing is declination hits of Mars of 19 deg 51'.

Rule 7a:
Mars right ascension 19 h 20 m differential.

BA: We're not big on RA, and we're going to avoid RA in Nucleo.

Rule 8a:
Mars right ascension 11 h 20 m differential

BA: We're skipping this.

Rule 9a:
Mars right ascension at full hours.

BA: We're skipping this.

Rule 10a:
Mars right ascension plus daily variation of Venus heliocentric extreme longitude (1 deg 37' 32").

BA: We're skipping this.

Rule 11a:
Venus R.A. plus 4 times the daily extreme variation of Venus longitude (1 deg 37' 32")

BA: No thanks Bayer.





BA: Overview of what we've done here: We've come to learn some astrolonomy through the files.  We need to learn how to apply.  It's relevance is it that this is the path.  Bayer is leading us into that with this book.  This is the beginning.  I'm not saying that these rules will make you a millionaire, but I'm saying this is a great place to start.  You will need to start setting up some tests.  Get a list of 20 dates for the hits and go to the financial markets, were there actually turns there?  See if they work in your own market.  We talked about how to bend these rules to test and work for your own market.

BA: Does the affect of a combination work for many turns or was it just a fluke?

BA: Be aware of the weekend affect (i.e. aspect happening on Friday, but the high occured on Monday).  That can really throw people off.  You want to take that into account.
