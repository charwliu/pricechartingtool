Notes on the book "Secret of the Ages" by Robert Collier

pg. 29

For mind does its building solely by the power of thought.  Its creations take form according to its thought.  Its first requisite is a mental image, and your desire held with unswerving purpose will form that mental image.  

When you pray earnestly you form a mental image of hte thing that you desire and you hold it strongly in your thought.  

pg. 33

The primal cause is mind.  Everything must start with an idea.  Every event, every condition, every thing is first an idea in the mind of someone.  

Mind draws the plan.  Thought forms the blueprint, well drawn or badly done, as your thoughts are clear or vague.  

Every condition, every experience of life is the result of our mental attitude.  We can do only what we think we can do.  We can be only what we think we can be.  We can have only what we think we can have.  What we do, what we are, what we have, all depend upon what we think.  We can never express anything that we do not first have in mind.  The secret of all power, all success, all riches, is in first thinking powerful thoughs, successful thoughts, and thoughts of wealth, of supply.  We must build them in our own mind first.

pg. 36

The world is to each one of us the world of his individual perceptions.


You are like a radio receiving station. Every moment thousands of impressions are reaching you. You can tune in on whatever ones you like—on joy or sorrow, on success or failure, on optimism or fear. You can select the particular impressions that will best serve you, you can hear only what you want to hear, you can shut out all disagreeable thoughts and sounds and experiences, or you can tune in on discouragement and failure and despair.

Yours is the choice. You have within you a force against which the whole world is powerless. By using it, you can make what you will of life and of your surroundings.

pg. 37

May not your waking existence be largely the creation of your own mind, just as your dream pictures are?

The most powerful forces of man are his invisible forces: his thought forces.

pg. 38

For verily I say unto you, that whosoever shall say unto this mountain, Be thou removed, and be thou cast into the sea; and shall not doubt in his heart, but shall believe that those things which he saith shall come to pass; he shall have whatsoever he saith.


No matter how hard you may work for success, if your thought is saturated with the fear of failure, it will kill your efforts, neutralize your endeavors, and make success impossible.

pg. 39

“The Kingdom of Heaven is within you.” Heaven is not some far-away state—the reward of years of tribulation here. Heaven is right here—here and now! When Christ said that Heaven was within us, He meant just what He said—that the power for happiness, for good, for everything we need of life, is within each one of us.

For the world without is but a reflection of that world within. Your thought creates the conditions your mind images. Keep before your mind’s eye the image of all you want to be and you will see it reflected in the world without. Think abundance, feel abundance, BELIEVE abundance, and you will find that as you think and feel and believe, abundance will manifest itself in your daily life. But let fear and worry be your mental companions, thoughts of poverty and limitation dwell in your mind, and worry and fear, limitation and poverty will be your constant companions day and night.

pg. 40

What is money but a mere idea of mind, a token of exchange?

pg. 41

Wealth is in ideas, not in money or property.  You can control those ideas through mind.  

pg. 41-42

Thought externalizes itself. What we are depends entirely upon the images we hold before our mind’s eye. Every time we think, we start a chain of causes, which will create conditions similar to the thoughts, which originated it. Every thought we hold in our consciousness for any length of time becomes impressed upon our subconscious mind and creates a pattern, which the mind weaves into our life or environment.

All power is from within and is therefore under our own control. When you can direct your thought processes, you can consciously apply them to any condition, for all that comes to us from the world without is what we’ve already imaged in the world within.

Do you want more money? Sit you down now quietly and realize that money is merely an idea. That your mind is possessed of unlimited ideas. That being part of Universal Mind, there is no such thing as limitation or lack. That somewhere, somehow, the ideas that shall bring you all the money you need for any right purpose are available for you. That you have but to put it up to your subconscious mind to find these ideas.

Realize that—believe it—and your need will be met. “What things so ever ye desire, when ye pray, believe that ye receive it and ye shall have it.” Don’t forget that “believe that ye receive it.” This it is that images the thing you want on your subconscious mind. And this it is that brings it to you. Once you can image the belief clearly on your subconscious mind, “whatsoever it is that ye ask for . . . ye shall have it.”

pg. 42

All growth, all supply is from the world-within. If you would have power, if you would have wealth, you have but to image it on this world within, on your subconscious mind, through belief and understanding.

pg. 44

Learn to control your thought. Learn to image upon your mind only the things you want to see reflected there.

You will never improve yourself by dwelling upon the drawbacks of your neighbors. You will never attain perfect health and strength by thinking of weak-ness or disease. No man ever made a perfect score by watching his rival’s target. You have got to think strength, think health, think riches. To paraphrase Pascal— “Our achievements today are but the sum of our thoughts of yesterday.”

For thought is energy. Mental images are concentrated energy. And energy concentrated on any definite purpose becomes power.

pg. 45

You can call upon your inner forces at will. There are three steps necessary:
1) Realize that you have the power.
2) Know what you want. (Desire).
3) Center your thought upon it with singleness of purpose.

[rluu: There must be belief that you will receive it also.]

pg. 47

You've got to know what you want before you stand much chance of getting it.

pg. 49

Remember this -- there is no condition so hopeless, no life so far gone, that mind cannot redeem it.  

pg. 50

You've got to concentrate on ONE IDEA AT A TIME.

All concentration ever is: getting so interested in some one thing that you pay no attention to anything else that is going on around you.

Hold in your mind the thing you most desire.  Affirm it.  Believe it to be an existing fact. 

pg. 51

You can have anything you want—if you want it badly enough. You can be anything you want to be, have anything you desire, accomplish anything you set out to accomplish—if you will hold to that desire with singleness of purpose; if you will understand and BELIEVE in your own powers to accomplish.

What is it that you wish in life? Is it health? In the chapter on health I will show you that you can be radiantly well—without drugs, without tedious exercises. It matters not if you are crippled or bedridden or infirm. Your body rebuilds itself entirely every eleven months. You can start now rebuilding along perfect lines.

Your desire must be visualized, must be persisted in, must be concentrated upon, and must be impressed upon your subconscious mind. Don’t bother about the means for accomplishing your desire—you can safely leave that to your subconscious mind.

pg. 52

Pray is just an earnest desire that we take to Universal Mind for fulfillment.

pg. 53

Go where you can be alone, where you can concentrate your thoughts on your one innermost sincere desire, where you can impress that desire upon your subconscious mind without distraction, and so reach the Universal Mind.

Model your prayer after the Pslamists of old:
They first asked for that which they wanted, then killed all doubts and fears by affirming God’s power and His willingness to grant their prayers. So when you pray, ask for the things that you want. Then affirm God’s readiness and His Power to grant your prayer.

pg. 55

But remember: you would not plant a valuable seed in your garden, and then, a day or a week later, go out and dig it up to see if it were sprouting. On the contrary, you would nourish it each morning with water. It is the same with your prayers. Don’t plant the seed of your desire in your subconscious mind and then go out the next morning and tear it up with doubts and fears. Nourish it by holding in thought the thing you desire, by believing in it, visualizing it, SEEING it as an accomplished fact.

pg. 55-56

If you ask for my own formula for successful prayer, I would say—

1) Center your thoughts on the thing that you want. Visualize it. Make a mental image of it. You are planting the seed of Desire. But don’t be content with that. Planting alone will not make a seed of corn grow. It has to be warmed by sunshine, nurtured by rain. So with the seed of your Desire. It must be warmed by Faith, nurtured by constant Belief.

2) Read the 91st and the 23rd Psalms, just as a reminder of God’s power and His readiness to help you in all your needs.

3) Don’t forget to be thankful, not merely for past favors, but for the granting of this favor you are now asking! To be able to thank God for it sincerely, in advance of its actual material mani-festation, is the finest evidence of belief.

4) BELIEVE! Picture the thing that you want so clearly, see it in your imagination so vividly, that for the moment, at least, you will actually BELIEVE THAT YOU HAVE IT!

It is this sincere conviction, registered upon your subconscious mind, and through it upon Universal Mind that brings the answer to your prayers. Once convince your subconscious mind that you HAVE the thing you want, and you can forget it and go on to your next problem. Mind will attend to the bringing of it into being.
