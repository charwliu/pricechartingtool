Notes on "Sefer Yetzirah" [translation and commentary] by Aryeh Kaplan.
##############################################################################

pg. ix-x

Kabbalah is divided into three categories:
 - Theoretical
 - Meditative
 - Magical

Theoretical Kabbalah: Based largely on the Zohar.  It is concerned mostly with the dynamics of the spiritual domain, especially the worlds of the Sefirot, souls, and angels.  

Meditative Kabbalah: Use of divine names, letter permutations, and similar methods to reach higher states of consciousness, and as such, comprises a kind of yoga.  

Magical Kabbalah: Closely related to the meditative.  It consists of various signs, incantations and divine names, through which one can influence or alter natural events.  

pg. x

Sefer Yetzirah: The book of creation.  This is the book of the Letters of Abraham.


"if your heart runs, return to the place."
"understand with wisdom, and be wise with understanding."


pg. xi-xii

Parts of the Sefer Yetzirah:

  - Chapter 1:   
      Introduction of the Sefirot.

  - Chapter 2:   
      General discussion about the letters of the alphabet.  
        5 phonetic families
        231 gates.

  - Chapter 3-5: 
      3 divisions of the letters: 
        mothers
        doubles
        elementals

  - Chapter 6:
      "axis, cycle and heart."
      Link between Sefer Yetzirah and Abraham.

pg. xiv

The mysteries of Sefer Yetzirah were used again after Exodus, when the Israelites were building the Tabernacle in the desert.  The Talmud states that Betzalel had been chosen to build this Tabernacle because he "knew how to permute the letters which heaven and earth were created."

The Talmud derives this from the verse where God says, "I have called in the name of Betzalel... and I have filled him with the spirit of God, with wisdom, understanding, and knowledge." (Exodus 31:2-3).

Wisdom = Chokmah
Understanding = Binah
Knowledge = Daat

Jeremiah the prophet also made use of the Sefer Yetzirah, but did so together with his son, Ben Sirah.  

pg. xvii

Josephus also likens the Essenes to the Pythagoreans.  The Sefer Yetzirah apparently contains some elements that resemble the teachings of the Pythagoreans.  

Crowns on letters; many important teachings can be derived from these crowns.  

pg. xix

"Betzalel knew how to permute the letters with which heaven and earth were created." - Attributed to "Rav Yehudah in the name of Rav".

There is also evidence that Rave Yehudah learned the mysteries of the 42 letter Name from Rav.

pg. xx

Mysteries of the Merkava (Merkaba).

Rabbi Elazar thus said, "The paragraphs of the Torah are not in order.  If they were in [correct] order, anyone who read them would be able to [create a world,] resurrect the dead, and perform miracles."

pg. xxiv-xxv

The four important versions of Sefer Yetzirah:

1) The Short version
2) The Long version
3) The Saadia version
4) The Gra version (or the Gra-Ari version)

This book [translation and commentary by Aryeh Kaplan] is based on the Gra version since it was considered the most authentic by Kabbalists.  The other translations are included in Appendix I.  



pg. 5

32 paths: 10 digits + 22 letters of the Hebrew alphabet.  

The 10 digits are also manifest in the Ten Sefirot.


pg. 7

According to the Kabbalists, these 32 paths are alluded to in the Torah by the 32 times thatGod's name Elohim appears in teh account of creation in teh first chapter of Genesis.

"God said" appears 10 times, and these are the Ten Sayings with which the world was created.  These parallel the Ten Sefirot.

The other 22 times that God's name appears parallel the 22 letters of the alphabet.  

The 3 times in which the expression "God made" appears parallel the 3 mothers.
The 7 times in which the expression "God saw" appears parallel the 7 doubles.
The 12 times that remained parallel the 12 elementals.

[See table 2 on pg. 6-7 for the details about how each verse lines up exactly.]



In general, none of the names of God refer to the Creator Himself.  The Creator is only referred to as "Ain Sof", which means Infinite Being, or simply, the Infinite.  The names used in scripture and elsewhere merely refer to the various ways through which God manifests Himself in creation.  

pg. 9

32 paths are the channel through which the Mind exerts control over creation.

In Hebrew, 32 is written Lamed, Bet.  This spells "Lev", the Hebrew word for heart.

Thus, the Sefer Yetzirah calls the heart "the king over the soul".  it also describes the mystical experience as a "running of the heart".

pg. 10

The number 32 is 2^5.  

As the Sefer Yetzirah explains, the Ten sefirot define a 5 dimensional space.  The 32 paths correspond to the number of apexes on a 5 dimensional hypercube.  


The 32 paths of Wisdom are called Netivot (private paths, as opposed to public paths like roads).

pg. 11

These paths are said to be mystical, "Peliyot".  

Miracle is "Peleh", in Hebrew.  A miracle is 'separated' and independent from the laws of the physical world.  

According ot the Zohar, the word "Peleh" specifically relates to the paths of Wisdom.  The type of miracle denoted by the word "Peleh" is specifically one that is accomplished through the manipulation of these paths.  The methods of manipulating these paths is one of the important teachings of Sefer yetzirah.  

The Sefer Yetzirah calls the 3 Mothers, "a great mystical (muPhLA) secret".  

According to the Kabbalists, Aleph denotes Keter (Crown), the highest of the Sefirot.  It is with regard to Keter that Ben Sirah said, "In what is mysterious (muPhLA) for you, do not seek."

Kabbalists call Keter the level of Nothingness (Ayin).  It is on this level that the laws of nature cease to exist, and can therefore be altered.

The book of Raziel points out that the three letters of "Peleh" represent increasingly hidden values (transition from the revealed to the concealed).


The 32 paths are said to be paths of Wisdom (Chokmah).  

pg. 13

Wisdom and Understanding are seen as being male and female, respectively.

Wisdom is seen as the Father (Abba).
Understanding is seen as the Mother (Immah).

The male represents the unchanneled creative force.  This can only be brought into fruition when delineated, enclosed, and channeled by the female womb.  That's why the Sefer Yetzirah calls the primary letters "Mothers".


This also resolves another difficulty.  Earlier, we said that the 32 paths represent the heart, since the Hebrew word for heart, Lev, actually spells out the number 32.  The heart, however is normally associated with Understanding, while these paths are said to pertain to Wisdom.  But the paths merely channel Wisdom, while the substance of the paths themselves is Understanding.  

[rluu: Hmm, think on this some more later.]


pg. 14

"Chaos and Void" (Tohu and Bohu)


Infinite Being (Ain Sof) who is above all the divine Names.


pg. 15

Some early Kabbalists interpret the first verse in genesis to read,
"In the beginning, He (Ain Sof) created Elohim, along with the heaven and the earth."


pg. 15-16

"Yah" = "the Eternal"   [the translation according to Saadia Gaon]

Kabbalists normatively associate the name Yah (spelled: Yod Heh) with Wisdom (Chokmah).
Actually however, only the first letter of this name does:
Yod designates Wisdom  (male principle)
Heh designates Understanding  (female principle)

Yod is 10, indicating that 10 Sefirot are included in Wisdom.
Heh is 5, alluding to the 5 fingers of the hand.  As such, it represents Understanding, the hand that holds Wisdom, distributing and channeling it.  

There is some disagreement in teh Talmud as to whether or not Yah is a divine name.  The Sefer Yetzirah clearly takes the position that it is a divine name.  

pg. 16

"Yah, the Lord" = YH YHVH.
It was with these 6 letters that God created all things.  It is thus written, "Trust in God for eternity of eternities, for with YH YHVH He formed universes." (Isaiah 26:4).


"The Lord of Hosts".  
This name usually designates the Serfirot which are associated with revelation and prophecy.  These are Netzach (Victory) and Hod (Splendor).  
This name, however also contains the Tetragrammaton (YHVH), here translated as "the Lord".The Tetragrammaton designates the totality of all the Sefirot.  Hence, the phrase, "YHVH of Hosts," actually represents all the Sefirot as they are revealed to man.  


pg. 17

"God of Israel".
This is connected to "Lord of Hosts."  While revelation in general is to all of God's hosts, in particular, it is granted to Israel.  As we shall see (2:4), the name Israel is closely associated with the 231 gates.  The Hebrew word for "God" here is Elohim.  


"The Living God"
The name is associated with the essential creative forces, represented by the Sefirah of Yesod (Foundation).  In man, this force parallels the sexual organ.  
In Hebrew, this phrase is "Elohim Chaim".


"King of the Universe"
This is the mode in which God relates to the universe as a king, and it is associated with the Sefirah of Malkhut (Kingship/Kingdom).  Of all the Sefirot, this is the only one which comes into direct contact with the lower stages of creation.  


The first five designations, "Yah, the Lord of Hosts, God of Israel, the Living God, King of the Universe," thus designate the 10 Sefirot in their downward mode, as they are the source of all creative force.  


pg. 17-18

"El Shaddai" = "Almighty God"        (as usually translated).
             = "Omnipotent Almighty" (as translated by Saadia Gaon).
Here the Sefer Yetzirah begins designating the Sefirot in an upward mode.  
"El Shaddi" is also related to the procreative force represented by Yesod (Foundation), and corresponding to the sexual organ of man.


We now have two designations for Yesod (Foundation):
"Living God" attribution to Yesod (Foundation) is the God's eye view.
"El Shaddai" attribution to Yesod (Foundation) is the Man's eye view.

pg. 18

"Merciful and Gracious"
These are the 2nd and 3rd of the "Thirteen Attributes of Mercy", expressed in teh verse, "El, merciful and gracious" (Exodus 34:6).

On this level, one can comprehend the inner workings of the six Sefirot, through which God expresses His mercy to the world:
  - Chesed (Love)
  - Gevurah (Strength)
  - Tiferet (Beauty)
  - Netzach (Victory)
  - Hod (Splendor)



"High and Exalted" refers to the level of Understanding (Binah).

The lower seven Sefirot correspond to the seven days of creation:
  - Chesed (Love)
  - Gevurah (Strength)
  - Tiferet (Beauty)
  - Netzach (Victory)
  - Hod (Splendor)
  - Yesod (Foundation)
  - Malkuth (Kingdom)


pg. 19

"His Name is Holy" alludes to the level of Keter (Crown).
"Holy" == "Kadosh"

"His Name" = 346.


"With three books":
These three books are said to be:
  - "Text"          (Sepher)   --> Letters
  - "Number"        (Sephar)   --> Numbers
  - "Communication" (Sippur)   --> The manner in which they are used.


pg. 20

The Sefer yetzirah speaks of a five-dimensional continuum, defined by the Ten Sefirot.


pg. 23

Sefer Yetzirah defines 32 paths as consisting of 10 Sefirot and 22 letters.

"Sefirah" == "counting"
"Mispar" == "number"


Although the Sefirot are said to represent the 10 basic digits, they are not actual numbers.  Rather, they are the sources from which the numbers originate.  


In recounting Betzalel's qualifications, God says, "I have filled him with the spirit of God, with Wisdom, with Understanding, and with Knowledge" (Exodus 31:3).

"spirit of God" refers to Keter (Crown).  (1:9)

"With Wisdom, God established the earth, and with Understanding, He established the heavens, and with His KNowlege, the depths were broken up" (Proverbs 3:19,20).

"With Wisdom a house is built, with Understanding it is established, and wish Knowledge its rooms are filled" (Proverbs 24:3,4).

pg. 25

All these sources list three qualities:
  - Wisdom (Chokmah)
  - Understanding (Binah)
  - Knowledge (Daat)

Knowledge, however, is not a Sefirah, but merely the point of confluence between Wisdom and Understanding.  In many ways, it behaves as a Sefirah, and it is thus often included among them.  


The next seven Sefirot are named in the verse,
"Yours O God are the God are the Greatness (4), the Strength (5), the Beauty (6), the Victory (7), and the Splendor (8), for All (9) in heaven and in earth; Yours O God is the Kingdom (10)..." (1 Chronicles 29:11).  


"Of Nothingness" == "Beli-mah".
This word can also be translated as meaning closed, abstract, absolute or ineffable.  

The text is thus speaking of "Ten Ineffable Sefirot," indicating they cannot be descirbed in any manner whatever.  


pg. 26



22 Foundation Letters.
"Otiot Yesod" == "Foundation Letters"

It is through the letters of the Hebrew alphabet that the universe was created.

What the Talmud says of the builder of the Tabernacle:
"Betzalel knew how to permute the letters with which heaven and earth were made."

pg. 27

The very words and letters with which the universe was created are also the ones which constantly sustain it.  If these words or letters were withdrawn for even an instant, the universe would cease to exist.


Foundation (Yesod) corresponds to the sexual organ.

God says of Betzalel, "I will fill him with the spirit of God, with Wisdom, with Understanding, and with Knowledge." (Exodus 31:3).


Three Mothers
  - Aleph
  - Mem
  - Shin

pg. 28

On the Tree of Life:
  Points      : Sefirot
  Horizontals : Mothers
  Verticals   : Doubles
  Diagonals   : Elementals

pg. 29

[Diagram with the 32 paths as defined by the Ari.]

pg. 30

[Diagram with the 32 paths as defined by the Gra.]

pg. 31

[rluu: Interestingly, the mothers, are the 1st, 13th, and 21st letters, which are numbers in the fibonnachi sequence.  Their numbers are 1, 40, and 300.  Are there any other correlations?]

The mother letters are called "mothers" because, in general, the letters are derived from understanding (Binah).  

"For you shall call Understanding a Mother" (Proverbs 2:3).

Since these are the primary letters, they are called "Mothers".

On a more basic level, these letters are "mothers" because the number of horizontal links defines the order of the array.


Seven Doubles
These are the seven letters that can express two sounds:
  - Bet
  - Gimel
  - Dalet
  - Kaf
  - Peh
  - Resh
  - Tav

The Elementals are the 12 remaining letters, which have a single sound.
