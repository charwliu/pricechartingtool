Notes on the book "The Kabala Of Numbers, Book 1", by Sepharial

rluu 20120626: I took 3 pages of paper notes on this book already.  The below electronic notes are a continuation of those paper notes starting from page 17 of the book.

pg. 19
Our thought, which is three-dimensional, is capable of generating from the evolutions of a point these figures -- the sphere, the cone, and the cube; and their superficial equivalents -- the circle, the triangle, and the square; with their perverts -- the oblong and the ellipse.  

These figures have always been used in symbolical thought to represent states of consciousness.  

But we are only concerned with them as related to the numbers 1, 3, 4.  These are denoted and connected as follows:

1 : God                                : Osiris
3 : Humanity [spirit, soul, and body]  : Horus
4 : Nature                             : Isis

pg. 20
The cross represents matter, which is the cube unfolded.  

All geometrical relations are expressions of numerical ratios.  

Numbers don't have any qualities or virtues of their own, but that they acquire such by reason of their quantitive relations to the causative world, which is the world of thought.  A number is a seal or impress of natural law as surely as is the shape of a flower, the sound of an atmospheric vibration, the color of an etheric wave.  The significance of a number answers to definite archetypal or noumenal relations.  

pg. 22
There is a system of interpretation in numerology which is supported by experience, but has its origin beyond the realm of phenomenal world.  This is used in divination.  

The laws of thoguht imposed on us by nature:
Sun   : Circle    : 1
Moon  : Triangle  : 3
Earth : Plus sign : 4

as by the most complex demonstration of the 'Principia' of Newton or the three laws of Kepler.  

pg. 23
All symbols, i.e. ideographs, are geometrical expressions of thought.  So figures are expressions of numbers, as numbers are of quantitive relations.  

pg. 25
If it is true that Pythagoras said: 
"The world is built upon the power of numbers," then numbers must be the key to understanding of the world.  

pg. 26
Some systems use literal values, i.e. the numerical power of letters, and other by the sound by or phonetic values.  Example of each is given on pg. 26.
Table of letter values is on page 30.  Another phonetic example is given on page 35.  

pg. 27
Many people have used with great success, the values attached to numbers by the Tarot.  Reference to book: "The Key to the Tarot", by A. E. Waite.  London.  

The 22 Major Keys are given briefly on page 27.

pg. 30
Hebraic, Pythagorean and phonetic values for the letters and numbers are given.

pg. 31
The ancient writers veiled their secrets by employed one of three methods:

a) The Temurah: Letters of a word were replaced by others after a definite method.  They first wrote the alphabet in three lines, representing the units, tens, and hundreds.  These lines, each of nine letters, were divided again into three groups, making 9 in all.  Any letter falling in the same group could be interchanged with another in the same group.  

b) Gimetria: This was an arithmetical method by which each word was replaced by another having the same numerical value.  

c) Notaricon: Selection was made of certain letters according to the rules of the art, these letters being taking from teh beginning, middle, or end of the words in a sentence, so as to produce a single word from their combination.  

pg. 31, 32
Finally, they had a secret writing, which was based upon the Temurah.  The pythagorean alphabet is used in connection with the interpretation employed in that system.  In this system, every number up to 50, rising thence by 10's to 100, has a definite signification; and every succeeding hundred has a separate meaning.  To these original interpretations others of a fanciful nature have since been added, as 365 = "astronomy and astrology"; and 666 = "enmity, secret plots, maliciousness" because of its use in the Apocalypse as the number or name of The Beast, when in fact, which as James Pryse has shown, meant no more than the animal mind -- i.e. the natural or lower intelligence of the average man.  The table of values are given on page 32 to 34.

Example of the use of this technique is shown on page 34.  

pg. 38, 39
System employing the Hebrew values of letters to a person's signature.  See page 39.  The procedure is not as clearly explained here, but it is explained on page 62, with an example on page 63.  

pg. 40
Two techniques given for determing the signature of the year:

1) The signature of each year can be obtained by adding the key number to the current year, and then reducing, and then checking the Tarot card corresponding to that value.  

2) The signature of each year can be obtained by adding the age of the person to the current year.  The value reduced and checked against the Tarot corresponding to that value.  

pg. 41 through 53 showing the use of the 3 by 3 square with numbers, and examples.  [rluu: In the examples, I haven't figured out exactly how he is getting the planets he is getting.  Some of the combinations with planets that I think should be there for the technique I think he is doing, he does not list sometimes.]

pg. 43
The technique is to take the date on which a person is born, emploing always the date at noon preceding the hour of birth, for this is the true solar date, bing 12 hours behind the secular date.  Thus, 26th June, at 5:40 pm = 26th, while 26th June at 9:00 am === 25th.  

pg. 45, 46
Table of numbers and their meanings are given for this system:

1. Stands for individuality, domination, egotism. 
2. Flexibility, change, instability, traveling.  
3. Expansion, increase, growth, opulence, congestion, riches. 
4. Realization, materiality, practical results, pride, ostentation.  
5. Intellection, learning, activity, commerce, language, science.  
6. Art, poetry, music, the social accomplishments, affection, love, sympathy.
7. Psychic force, influence, popularity, voyages, adaptability, versatility, progress.  
8. Corruption, disease, death, decay, loss, hurt, imperfection, obstruction, privation.  
9. Freedom, energy, keenness, acumen, zeal, penetration, fire, fever.  

pg. 54
Sepharial says the system of numerical kabalism he is here unfolding is linked up with other subjects through an astrological tradition. 
[rluu: "Here" as in in this chapter or as in in this book?  The current chapter spans from pages 54 to 61.]

Numbers have a signification or symbolical value irrespective of:
a) Our recognition of their symbolism
b) What we are led to recognize as natural causation.

Law of permutations: ((2^n) - 1)

Thus, possible combinations of any three principles, sounds, or colors, = 2 x 2 x 2 - 1 = 7.

You may or may not read the signal, but that does not in any way alter either the law expressed by the formula or the truth of the expression.  

[rluu: Sepharial emphasizes this as if it is extremely important.]
[rluu: Is 'n' in the formula the number of letters?  Or perhaps the birth name or birth date numbers, or maybe the Sun position at birth?]

pg. 55
Sepharial has already affirmed the universe as a symbol.  It exists, and has existed for immense ages as a symbol.  Symbol is the language of nature.  

After the Triune Deity, the ancients placed the seven great powers or archangels.  "The One produced the Three, the Three produced the seven.  These ten are all things."

[rluu: Where is this quote from?  What is this quote saying?]

Scorpio, has associated symbols Serpentarius and Draconis, nocturnal, poisonful, and death-dealing.  

After the 7th day of creation or unfoldment, death makes its appearance in teh world.  That is to say after the universe has attained its fullness of evolution, it will begin to devolve.


There is no natural sequence between the number 8 and the things that number signifies to us [sinister and unfortunate things, death, decay, ruin]. We may affirm that it [rluu: the number 8?] exists apart from natural causation, for there is no causative relation between the occurrence of a number in a man's name or the date of his birth, and any event or characteristic we may associate with such a number.  
[rluu: Note that Bayer says on pg. 64 of "Time Factors In The Stock Market" that "Everything is alive; what we call death, equalling definite destruction, cannot be found in this world.  All is change, revolution, return, evolution."]


pg. 57
In this kabalism system, the ancients had a conception of the relations of man to the universe, calling him, in fact, the microcosm.  They divided the microcosm into four principles:

1) The imperishable soul, which reflected the Trinity of Deific Powers. (Venus & Mercury).
2) The rational soul.
3) The animal soul.
4) The gross body.

These they related to the cosmic bodies, conceiving them to be enveloped by an aura which defined their sphere of action and maintained their relationship, just as they held that the solar system was limited by a crystalline sphere.  

The cosmos was thus completed, the surrounding and enfolding sphere of Jupiter, which they called the auric body.  

pg. 59

The sum of the numbers (1 through 9) is 45 = 15 * 3.  The triple name [Hebrew word for "Jah", see book pg. 59], in the understanding of which we are exhorted to praise.  

[rluu: Is this "3" here the 3 days and 3 nights of the Jonah riddle?  Thus 3 days and 3 nights would be 90 degrees?]

[rluu: 
From http://www.greateststoryevertold.org/jah.html
Jah (Yahh in Hebrew)
is a contraction of the root word Jehovah (Yehovah in Hebrew),meaning "the existing one", the proper name of the one true God. This is the only time Jah is used in the King James Version of the Bible. This word is used and translated as LORD 45 other times in the Old Testament, KJV.

From http://concordances.org/hebrew/3050.htm
Yah: the name of the God of Israel
Original Word: יָהּ
Part of Speech: Proper Name
Transliteration: Yah
Phonetic Spelling: (yaw)
Short Definition: LORD
Definition: the name of the God of Israel
NASB Translation: GOD (1), LORD (49).
]

The planetary forms (for the numbers):
9: Associated with all sharp, keen, and pointed things, such as are made of steel and iron, spears, lances, scalpels, swords, knives, flints, tongues of flame, etc.
8: Symbol fo involution, and represents all serpentine adn scroll forms, the convolute [spiral] and double convolute [2 spirals in the shape of a backward 'S'], the letter s, and all sibilant sounds, as in hissing.  
7: Represented by crescent forms, dexter curves, and horned shapes.  
6: Associated with symmetrical and well-formed bodies, graceful curves and rounded figures, in which symmetry and balance are the prevailing feature.  
5: Related to sharp but disjointed forms, articulations, links and jointed bodies.  
4: Connected with square bodies, rectangles, crosses, and horizontal lines.  
3: With triangles, tripodds, and bodies having three divisions; also with integumenta, envelopes, and spheroids, ovals, and bodies capable of expansion and contraction.  
2: Number associated with sinister curves, forms having round bases, as bowls, vases, etc., parallels and pairs of things, such as pillars, etc.
1: represents upright columns, monoliths, spheres, circles, perpendicular lines, and orifices.  

pg. 60

The colors associated with the planets, numbers, and forms, are:
9: Red or crimson
8: Black or deep brown
7: Silver or opalescence
6: Pale blue or turquoise.
5: Indigo or dark blue.
4: Orange or ruddy gold.
3: Violet.
2: Yellow or cream.
1: White.

The notes, or sounds answering ot hte planetary and therefore alos the numerical powers, and their appropriate colors, are as follows:

C : Sun     : 1 or 4
D : Saturn  : 8
E : Mercury : 5
F : Moon    : 7 or 2
G : Mars    : 9
A : Venus   : 6
B : Jupiter : 3


Sepharial says that he is certain that Shakespeare was neither Kabalist or Rosicrucian, but he employs knowledge of both faculties.  

pg. 61.
Deitic height of evolution is up to: 
6 + 9 = 15
which we need not aspire, contenting ourselves by "filling up the spaces in between".  
[rluu: Is this the breakdown of a day in the Jonah 3 days and 3 nights riddle?]

pg. 62, 63
System shown for analyzing the name according to the Kabala, using the 22 Major Keys of Tarot.  This is the same method as shown on pg. 38, 39, but with a better explanation.  On page 62 and 63 however, he does not explicitly mention that the method be applied only to a signature.  Example is given on page 63.  

pg. 62.
Each of the Tarotic numbers has a fourfold interpretation:
1) spiritual
2) intellectual
3) psychic
4) physical
The correspondence of which running from the world of principles to that of causes, thence to the world of effects, terminating in teh world of ultimates, which is the concrete world of physical phenomena.  

Sepharial says he gives the full interpreation of the twenty two Major Keys of the Tarot in his 'Manual of Occultism'.

pg. 64
Francis Bacon used anagram, cryptogram and a numerical kabala in his works.  
Example of his use of it is given (see text).

pg. 65
Pythagorean kabala is given, but Sepharial says that this system does not lend itself well to symbolism.

pg. 66
Symbolism can be seen with:
Hebrew code in connection with the Tarot.
Planetary [number] code in connection with astrology.

pg. 67
Sepharial says the "Secret Progression" kabala is published in the "Manual of Occultism".  

pg. 68
The "Secret Progression" (for lottery), when perfected, answers four tests:
1) The minor additive
2) The major additive
3) The minor differential
4) The major differential.

Examples of each of these tests follows in the text.

pg. 72
Law of numerical sequence == correlated successiveness. [Example given on pg. 71 with Kings and their reigning periods.]  This law of numerical sequence follows through cosmic relations also.  

Kepler's laws of planetary motion:
1) The orbins of the planets are ellipses with the Sun as one focus.
2) A line from the planet to the Sun sweeps over equal areas in equal intervals of time.
3) A planet's orbital period squared is proportional to its average distance from the Sun cubed.

A projectile force varies inversely as the square of the distance.  


Bode's law: The law relates the mean distances of the planets from the sun to a simple mathematic progression of numbers.  To find the mean distances of the planets, beginning with the following simple sequence of numbers: 0, 3, 6, 12, 24, 48, 96, 192, 384.  With the exception of the first two, the others are simple twice the value of the preceding number.  Add 4 to each number, and then divide each by 10.  The resulting sequence is very close to the distribution of mean distances of the planets from the Sun.  See webpage: http://www.astro.cornell.edu/academics/courses/astro201/bodes_law.htm

pg. 75

Sepharial says the theory of gravity may not be correct, because the facts do not answer to the theory of attraction.  When it is seen that intermolecular ether is negative to spatial ether, it may be found convenient to look at the obverse side of the door, that is, bodies may be impelled toward the earth by the "push" of spatial ether instead of being drawn to the earth by the "pull" of the earth's mass.  

pg. 76
The universe regarded as man: The Rosicrucians called it "Adam Kadmon", Swedenborg called it the "Grand Man", the Macroprosopus.

pg. 78

Mars-Saturn cycle: 265 years, the two planets perform 9 revolutions and return to nearly the same place in the zodiac.  When they conjunct in a sign, the countries ruled by that sign suffer ill effects.  

Country rulerships (Sepharial says according to ancient observations):

Sagittarius: Spain, Italy
Gemini: United States
Capricorn: India
Aquarius: Russia
Pisces: Portugal
Aries: England
Taurus: Ireland
Cancer: Scotland, Holland
Leo: France

pg. 81

Hindus say that the period of 120 years is the sum of a human life.

Ptolemy ascribed the periods of the planets as follows:
Moon: 4 years
Mercury: 10 years
Venus: 8 years
Mars: 15 years
Jupiter: 12 years
Saturn: 30 years

These values are all evenly divisible into 120.

Moon:     4 years into 120 = 30
Saturn:  30 years into 120 =  4
Moon and Saturn are opposed to one another in nature, and rule opposite signs.

Mercury: 10 years into 120 = 12
Jupiter: 12 years into 120 = 10
Jupiter and Mercury are opposed to one another, and rule opposite signs.

Venus:    8 years into 120 = 15
Mars:    15 years into 120 =  8
Jupiter and Mercury are opposed to one another, and rule opposite signs.

pg. 82

In one day, the Sun completes its apparent circuit of the heavens and advances 1 degree, making 361 degrees.  This quantity is 19 x 19, and Ptolemy gives the period of the Sun as 19 years.  

Sun and Moon are conjoined in the same point in the Zodiac every 19 years.  

pg. 83

There are 3 keys:
1) Astral key
2) Name key
3) Number key

pg. 84

Astral key is planetary hours.  

The day hours (local sunrise to local sunset) is divided by 12 to get the length of each day planetary hours.

The day hours (local sunset to local sunrise) is divided by 12 to get the length of each night planetary hours.

The order of rulerships of planetary hours is:
Sun, Venus, Mercury, Moon, Saturn, Jupiter, Mars.

The name of the day (of the week) is ruled by the planet lording of the first hour of that day.

pg. 89

For use with planetary numbers:
The 6 planetary hours from sunrise to noon are POSITIVE.
The 6 planetary hours from noon to sunset  are NEGATIVE.

pg. 90

Planetary numbers for the planets:

Planet   Positive #    Negative #    Sum, reduced
------   ----------    ----------    ------------
Sun      1             4             5
Moon     7             2             9
Saturn   8             1             9
Jupiter  3             6             9
Mars     9             5             5
Venus    6             3             9
Mercury  5             9             5


The positive and negative values of all planets add to a sum whose unit value is 5 or 9, whence we have the kabalistic value 5 + 9 = 14, i.e. the two aspects (male and female, positive and negative) of the Sevenfold Powers.

[rluu: The positive numbers are a number sequence, and the negative numbers are a number sequence.]

pg. 91

Each planetary hour is divided into 7 equal parts, where the first subdivision of the hour is lorded by the same planet as the hour.  The subdivisions are in the same order as the planetary hours.  

[rluu: Is Sepharial dividing the noon to the sunset by 6 to get the lengths of evening planetary hours?  Why not do sunrise to sunset divided by 12?  Is it because he is actually using local noon time [Sun at MC, or highest place in sky]?]

pg. 92, 93
Horse racing example given, using phonetic values of the names of the horses.  These numbers are compared with the number related to the planetary period.  

[rluu: The phonetic values used by Sepharial in some places seems a bit subjective.]

The circle == infinity or zero, since all circles are equal to one another and converge in the point at the center.  

pg. 98, 99

If Nature employs a numerical symbolism, we may conformably employ certain numbers as symbols, and indeed all numbers, by reference to their components or their unit values.  When I [Sepharial] said that Nature uses a symoblism, and that it has consciousness of us as individuals, I regarded it mediately as the expression of Divine Intelligence.  It is in reality the Deity, who is conscious in and through Nature, as man is conscious in and through his body.  

Nature is a symbol, and it attains signification for us only when we understand it.  

pg. 102
Thought has two orders:
Conscious thought
Unconscious/Subconscious thought

Every brain, while functioning, creates definite vibrations or waves in the etheric ambient.  These waves impinge upon the brains of others, and, if in syntonic relations with them, will cause an apperception of personality, so that the individuals affected will immediately create a mental image of the person whose thought is projected.  

pg. 104
Each of us is connected to the world-soul (planetary or earth consciousness), and the world-soul is linked to the universal soul (solar sphere).  

The geometrical relations of thought are such that every idea is capable of numerical expression. 

pg. 107

From the Bible: "The sceptre shall not depart from Judah, nor the law-giver from between his feet, until Shiloh shall come."

"The sceptre" == Regulus
"the law-giver" == Cepheus
"Shiloh" or "Shuleh" == Cor Scorpio

Cor Scorpio, whose rising is the signal for Regulus to depart fromt he mid-heaven with its opposition point of Cepheus from the nadir.  

pg. 111

Technique of thought-reading (or resolution of questions) by numbers:

The mind having been fixed upon the question to be asked or the matter upon which information is sought, nine numbers are set down, to which 3 is added, and the numbers in the sun is then referred to for the nature of the question.  

Then look up the answer in the table given on pages 111 to 118.  

pg. 120

Technique given for locating lost things by numbers.  See table on pages 120 to 126.
