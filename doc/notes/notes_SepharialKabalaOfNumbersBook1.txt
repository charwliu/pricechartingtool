Notes on the book "The Kabala Of Numbers, Book 1", by Sepharial

rluu 20120626: I took 3 pages of paper notes on this book already.  The below electronic notes are a continuation of those paper notes starting from page 17 of the book.

pg. 19
Our thought, which is three-dimensional, is capable of generating from the evolutions of a point these figures -- the sphere, the cone, and the cube; and their superficial equivalents -- the circle, the triangle, and the square; with their perverts -- the oblong and the ellipse.  

These figures have always been used in symbolical thought to represent states of consciousness.  

But we are only concerned with them as related to the numbers 1, 3, 4.  These are denoted and connected as follows:

1 : God                                : Osiris
3 : Humanity [spirit, soul, and body]  : Horus
4 : Nature                             : Isis

pg. 20
The cross represents matter, which is the cube unfolded.  

All geometrical relations are expressions of numerical ratios.  

Numbers don't have any qualities or virtues of their own, but that they acquire such by reason of their quantitive relations to the causative world, which is the world of thought.  A number is a seal or impress of natural law as surely as is the shape of a flower, the sound of an atmospheric vibration, the color of an etheric wave.  The significance of a number answers to definite archetypal or noumenal relations.  

pg. 22
There is a system of interpretation in numerology which is supported by experience, but has its origin beyond the realm of phenomenal world.  This is used in divination.  

The laws of thoguht imposed on us by nature:
Sun   : Circle    : 1
Moon  : Triangle  : 3
Earth : Plus sign : 4

as by the most complex demonstration of the 'Principia' of Newton or the three laws of Kepler.  

pg. 23
All symbols, i.e. ideographs, are geometrical expressions of thought.  So figures are expressions of numbers, as numbers are of quantitive relations.  

pg. 25
If it is true that Pythagoras said: 
"The world is built upon the power of numbers," then numbers must be the key to understanding of the world.  

pg. 26
Some systems use literal values, i.e. the numerical power of letters, and other by the sound by or phonetic values.  Example of each is given on pg. 26.
Table of letter values is on page 30.  Another phonetic example is given on page 35.  

pg. 27
Many people have used with great success, the values attached to numbers by the Tarot.  Reference to book: "The Key to the Tarot", by A. E. Waite.  London.  

The 22 Major Keys are given briefly on page 27.

pg. 30
Hebraic, Pythagorean and phonetic values for the letters and numbers are given.

pg. 31
The ancient writers veiled their secrets by employed one of three methods:

a) The Temurah: Letters of a word were replaced by others after a definite method.  They first wrote the alphabet in three lines, representing the units, tens, and hundreds.  These lines, each of nine letters, were divided again into three groups, making 9 in all.  Any letter falling in the same group could be interchanged with another in the same group.  

b) Gimetria: This was an arithmetical method by which each word was replaced by another having the same numerical value.  

c) Notaricon: Selection was made of certain letters according to the rules of the art, these letters being taking from the beginning, middle, or end of the words in a sentence, so as to produce a single word from their combination.  

pg. 31, 32
Finally, they had a secret writing, which was based upon the Temurah.  The pythagorean alphabet is used in connection with the interpretation employed in that system.  In this system, every number up to 50, rising thence by 10's to 100, has a definite signification; and every succeeding hundred has a separate meaning.  To these original interpretations others of a fanciful nature have since been added, as 365 = "astronomy and astrology"; and 666 = "enmity, secret plots, maliciousness" because of its use in the Apocalypse as the number or name of The Beast, when in fact, which as James Pryse has shown, meant no more than the animal mind -- i.e. the natural or lower intelligence of the average man.  The table of values are given on page 32 to 34.

Example of the use of this technique is shown on page 34.  

pg. 38, 39
System employing the Hebrew values of letters to a person's signature.  See page 39.  The procedure is not as clearly explained here, but it is explained on page 62, with an example on page 63.  

pg. 40
Two techniques given for determing the signature of the year:

1) The signature of each year can be obtained by adding the key number to the current year, and then reducing, and then checking the Tarot card corresponding to that value.  

2) The signature of each year can be obtained by adding the age of the person to the current year.  The value reduced and checked against the Tarot corresponding to that value.  [This technique and examples of it are given on pages 130 and 133].

pg. 41 through 53 showing the use of the 3 by 3 square with numbers, and examples.  

[rluu: In the examples, I haven't figured out exactly how he is getting the planets he is getting.  Some of the combinations with planets that I think should be there for the technique I think he is doing, he does not list sometimes.]

[rluu: Sepharial also covers this 3x3 square also in Kabala of Numbers, book 2, on pages 91-95.  Perhaps how the technique works can be gleamed from the examples in this other book.]

pg. 43
The technique is to take the date on which a person is born, emploing always the date at noon preceding the hour of birth, for this is the true solar date, bing 12 hours behind the secular date.  Thus, 26th June, at 5:40 pm = 26th, while 26th June at 9:00 am === 25th.  

pg. 45, 46
Table of numbers and their meanings are given for this system:

1. Stands for individuality, domination, egotism. 
2. Flexibility, change, instability, traveling.  
3. Expansion, increase, growth, opulence, congestion, riches. 
4. Realization, materiality, practical results, pride, ostentation.  
5. Intellection, learning, activity, commerce, language, science.  
6. Art, poetry, music, the social accomplishments, affection, love, sympathy.
7. Psychic force, influence, popularity, voyages, adaptability, versatility, progress.  
8. Corruption, disease, death, decay, loss, hurt, imperfection, obstruction, privation.  
9. Freedom, energy, keenness, acumen, zeal, penetration, fire, fever.  

pg. 54
Sepharial says the system of numerical kabalism he is here unfolding is linked up with other subjects through an astrological tradition. 
[rluu: "Here" as in in this chapter or as in in this book?  The current chapter spans from pages 54 to 61.]

Numbers have a signification or symbolical value irrespective of:
a) Our recognition of their symbolism
b) What we are led to recognize as natural causation.

Law of permutations: ((2^n) - 1)

Thus, possible combinations of any three principles, sounds, or colors, = 2 x 2 x 2 - 1 = 7.

You may or may not read the signal, but that does not in any way alter either the law expressed by the formula or the truth of the expression.  

[rluu: Sepharial emphasizes this as if it is extremely important.]
[rluu: Is 'n' in the formula the number of letters?  Or perhaps the birth name or birth date numbers, or maybe the Sun position at birth?]

pg. 55
Sepharial has already affirmed the universe as a symbol.  It exists, and has existed for immense ages as a symbol.  Symbol is the language of nature.  

After the Triune Deity, the ancients placed the seven great powers or archangels.  "The One produced the Three, the Three produced the seven.  These ten are all things."

[rluu: Where is this quote from?  What is this quote saying?]

Scorpio, has associated symbols Serpentarius and Draconis, nocturnal, poisonful, and death-dealing.  

After the 7th day of creation or unfoldment, death makes its appearance in the world.  That is to say after the universe has attained its fullness of evolution, it will begin to devolve.


There is no natural sequence between the number 8 and the things that number signifies to us [sinister and unfortunate things, death, decay, ruin]. We may affirm that it [rluu: the number 8?] exists apart from natural causation, for there is no causative relation between the occurrence of a number in a man's name or the date of his birth, and any event or characteristic we may associate with such a number.  
[rluu: Note that Bayer says on pg. 64 of "Time Factors In The Stock Market" that "Everything is alive; what we call death, equalling definite destruction, cannot be found in this world.  All is change, revolution, return, evolution."]


pg. 57
In this kabalism system, the ancients had a conception of the relations of man to the universe, calling him, in fact, the microcosm.  They divided the microcosm into four principles:

1) The imperishable soul, which reflected the Trinity of Deific Powers. (Venus & Mercury).
2) The rational soul.
3) The animal soul.
4) The gross body.

These they related to the cosmic bodies, conceiving them to be enveloped by an aura which defined their sphere of action and maintained their relationship, just as they held that the solar system was limited by a crystalline sphere.  

The cosmos was thus completed, the surrounding and enfolding sphere of Jupiter, which they called the auric body.  

pg. 59

The sum of the numbers (1 through 9) is 45 = 15 * 3.  The triple name [Hebrew word for "Jah", see book pg. 59], in the understanding of which we are exhorted to praise.  

[rluu: Is this "3" here the 3 days and 3 nights of the Jonah riddle?  Thus 3 days and 3 nights would be 90 degrees?]

[rluu: 
From http://www.greateststoryevertold.org/jah.html
Jah (Yahh in Hebrew)
is a contraction of the root word Jehovah (Yehovah in Hebrew),meaning "the existing one", the proper name of the one true God. This is the only time Jah is used in the King James Version of the Bible. This word is used and translated as LORD 45 other times in the Old Testament, KJV.

From http://concordances.org/hebrew/3050.htm
Yah: the name of the God of Israel
Original Word: יָהּ
Part of Speech: Proper Name
Transliteration: Yah
Phonetic Spelling: (yaw)
Short Definition: LORD
Definition: the name of the God of Israel
NASB Translation: GOD (1), LORD (49).
]

The planetary forms (for the numbers):
9: Associated with all sharp, keen, and pointed things, such as are made of steel and iron, spears, lances, scalpels, swords, knives, flints, tongues of flame, etc.
8: Symbol of involution, and represents all serpentine and scroll forms, the convolute [spiral] and double convolute [2 spirals in the shape of a backward 'S'], the letter s, and all sibilant sounds, as in hissing.  
7: Represented by crescent forms, dexter curves, and horned shapes.  
6: Associated with symmetrical and well-formed bodies, graceful curves and rounded figures, in which symmetry and balance are the prevailing feature.  
5: Related to sharp but disjointed forms, articulations, links and jointed bodies.  
4: Connected with square bodies, rectangles, crosses, and horizontal lines.  
3: With triangles, tripodds, and bodies having three divisions; also with integumenta, envelopes, and spheroids, ovals, and bodies capable of expansion and contraction.  
2: Number associated with sinister curves, forms having round bases, as bowls, vases, etc., parallels and pairs of things, such as pillars, etc.
1: represents upright columns, monoliths, spheres, circles, perpendicular lines, and orifices.  

pg. 60

The colors associated with the planets, numbers, and forms, are:
9: Red or crimson
8: Black or deep brown
7: Silver or opalescence
6: Pale blue or turquoise.
5: Indigo or dark blue.
4: Orange or ruddy gold.
3: Violet.
2: Yellow or cream.
1: White.

[rluu: On page 55 of Kabala of Numbers, Book 2, Sepharial gives different values.  He says that here in Kabala 1, the values given is in relation to our physical perception.  He says the table in Kabala 2, page 55, is correct in regard to the primary relations of color and number.]

The notes, or sounds answering to the planetary and therefore also the numerical powers, and their appropriate colors, are as follows:

C : Sun     : 1 or 4
D : Saturn  : 8
E : Mercury : 5
F : Moon    : 7 or 2
G : Mars    : 9
A : Venus   : 6
B : Jupiter : 3


Sepharial says that he is certain that Shakespeare was neither Kabalist or Rosicrucian, but he employs knowledge of both faculties.  

pg. 61.
Deitic height of evolution is up to: 
6 + 9 = 15
which we need not aspire, contenting ourselves by "filling up the spaces in between".  
[rluu: Is this the breakdown of a day in the Jonah 3 days and 3 nights riddle?]

pg. 62, 63
System shown for analyzing the name according to the Kabala, using the 22 Major Keys of Tarot.  This is the same method as shown on pg. 38, 39, but with a better explanation.  On page 62 and 63 however, he does not explicitly mention that the method be applied only to a signature.  Example is given on page 63.  

pg. 62.
Each of the Tarotic numbers has a fourfold interpretation:
1) spiritual
2) intellectual
3) psychic
4) physical
The correspondence of which running from the world of principles to that of causes, thence to the world of effects, terminating in the world of ultimates, which is the concrete world of physical phenomena.  

Sepharial says he gives the full interpreation of the twenty two Major Keys of the Tarot in his 'Manual of Occultism'.

pg. 64
Francis Bacon used anagram, cryptogram and a numerical kabala in his works.  
Example of his use of it is given (see text).

pg. 65
Pythagorean kabala is given, but Sepharial says that this system does not lend itself well to symbolism.

pg. 66
Symbolism can be seen with:
Hebrew code in connection with the Tarot.
Planetary [number] code in connection with astrology.

pg. 67
Sepharial says the "Secret Progression" kabala is published in the "Manual of Occultism".  

pg. 68
The "Secret Progression" (for lottery), when perfected, answers four tests:
1) The minor additive
2) The major additive
3) The minor differential
4) The major differential.

Examples of each of these tests follows in the text.

pg. 72
Law of numerical sequence == correlated successiveness. [Example given on pg. 71 with Kings and their reigning periods.]  This law of numerical sequence follows through cosmic relations also.  

Kepler's laws of planetary motion:
1) The orbits of the planets are ellipses with the Sun as one focus.
2) A line from the planet to the Sun sweeps over equal areas in equal intervals of time.
3) A planet's orbital period squared is proportional to its average distance from the Sun cubed.

A projectile force varies inversely as the square of the distance.  


Bode's law: The law relates the mean distances of the planets from the sun to a simple mathematic progression of numbers.  To find the mean distances of the planets, beginning with the following simple sequence of numbers: 0, 3, 6, 12, 24, 48, 96, 192, 384.  With the exception of the first two, the others are simple twice the value of the preceding number.  Add 4 to each number, and then divide each by 10.  The resulting sequence is very close to the distribution of mean distances of the planets from the Sun.  See webpage: http://www.astro.cornell.edu/academics/courses/astro201/bodes_law.htm

pg. 75

Sepharial says the theory of gravity may not be correct, because the facts do not answer to the theory of attraction.  When it is seen that intermolecular ether is negative to spatial ether, it may be found convenient to look at the obverse side of the door, that is, bodies may be impelled toward the earth by the "push" of spatial ether instead of being drawn to the earth by the "pull" of the earth's mass.  

pg. 76
The universe regarded as man: The Rosicrucians called it "Adam Kadmon", Swedenborg called it the "Grand Man", the Macroprosopus.

pg. 78

Mars-Saturn cycle: 265 years, the two planets perform 9 revolutions and return to nearly the same place in the zodiac.  When they conjunct in a sign, the countries ruled by that sign suffer ill effects.  

Country rulerships (Sepharial says according to ancient observations):

Sagittarius: Spain, Italy
Gemini: United States
Capricorn: India
Aquarius: Russia
Pisces: Portugal
Aries: England
Taurus: Ireland
Cancer: Scotland, Holland
Leo: France

pg. 81

Hindus say that the period of 120 years is the sum of a human life.

Ptolemy ascribed the periods of the planets as follows:
Moon: 4 years
Mercury: 10 years
Venus: 8 years
Mars: 15 years
Jupiter: 12 years
Saturn: 30 years

These values are all evenly divisible into 120.

Moon:     4 years into 120 = 30
Saturn:  30 years into 120 =  4
Moon and Saturn are opposed to one another in nature, and rule opposite signs.

Mercury: 10 years into 120 = 12
Jupiter: 12 years into 120 = 10
Jupiter and Mercury are opposed to one another, and rule opposite signs.

Venus:    8 years into 120 = 15
Mars:    15 years into 120 =  8
Jupiter and Mercury are opposed to one another, and rule opposite signs.

pg. 82

In one day, the Sun completes its apparent circuit of the heavens and advances 1 degree, making 361 degrees.  This quantity is 19 x 19, and Ptolemy gives the period of the Sun as 19 years.  

Sun and Moon are conjoined in the same point in the Zodiac every 19 years.  

pg. 83

There are 3 keys:
1) Astral key
2) Name key
3) Number key

pg. 84

Astral key is planetary hours.  

The day hours (local sunrise to local sunset) is divided by 12 to get the length of each day planetary hours.

The day hours (local sunset to local sunrise) is divided by 12 to get the length of each night planetary hours.

The order of rulerships of planetary hours is:
Sun, Venus, Mercury, Moon, Saturn, Jupiter, Mars.

The name of the day (of the week) is ruled by the planet lording of the first hour of that day.

[rluu: Regarding page 85, Sepharial on page 108 of 'Kabala of Numbers, Book 2' says he transposed the rule for sunrise time incorrectly.  See pg. 108 of 'Kabala of Numbers, Book 2' for the correct way to calculate sunrise.]

pg. 89

For use with planetary numbers:
The 6 planetary hours from sunrise to noon are POSITIVE.
The 6 planetary hours from noon to sunset  are NEGATIVE.

pg. 90

Planetary numbers for the planets:

Planet   Positive #    Negative #    Sum, reduced
------   ----------    ----------    ------------
Sun      1             4             5
Moon     7             2             9
Saturn   8             1             9
Jupiter  3             6             9
Mars     9             5             5
Venus    6             3             9
Mercury  5             9             5


The positive and negative values of all planets add to a sum whose unit value is 5 or 9, whence we have the kabalistic value 5 + 9 = 14, i.e. the two aspects (male and female, positive and negative) of the Sevenfold Powers.

[rluu: The positive numbers are a number sequence, and the negative numbers are a number sequence.]

pg. 91

Each planetary hour is divided into 7 equal parts, where the first subdivision of the hour is lorded by the same planet as the hour.  The subdivisions are in the same order as the planetary hours.  

[rluu: Is Sepharial dividing the noon to the sunset by 6 to get the lengths of evening planetary hours?  Why not do sunrise to sunset divided by 12?  Is it because he is actually using local noon time [Sun at MC, or highest place in sky]?]

pg. 92, 93
Horse racing example given, using phonetic values of the names of the horses.  These numbers are compared with the number related to the planetary period.  

[rluu: The phonetic values used by Sepharial in some places seems a bit subjective.]

The circle == infinity or zero, since all circles are equal to one another and converge in the point at the center.  

pg. 98, 99

If Nature employs a numerical symbolism, we may conformably employ certain numbers as symbols, and indeed all numbers, by reference to their components or their unit values.  When I [Sepharial] said that Nature uses a symoblism, and that it has consciousness of us as individuals, I regarded it mediately as the expression of Divine Intelligence.  It is in reality the Deity, who is conscious in and through Nature, as man is conscious in and through his body.  

Nature is a symbol, and it attains signification for us only when we understand it.  

pg. 102
Thought has two orders:
Conscious thought
Unconscious/Subconscious thought

Every brain, while functioning, creates definite vibrations or waves in the etheric ambient.  These waves impinge upon the brains of others, and, if in syntonic relations with them, will cause an apperception of personality, so that the individuals affected will immediately create a mental image of the person whose thought is projected.  

pg. 104
Each of us is connected to the world-soul (planetary or earth consciousness), and the world-soul is linked to the universal soul (solar sphere).  

The geometrical relations of thought are such that every idea is capable of numerical expression. 

pg. 107

From the Bible: "The sceptre shall not depart from Judah, nor the law-giver from between his feet, until Shiloh shall come."

"The sceptre" == Regulus
"the law-giver" == Cepheus
"Shiloh" or "Shuleh" == Cor Scorpio

Cor Scorpio, whose rising is the signal for Regulus to depart from the mid-heaven with its opposition point of Cepheus from the nadir.  

[rluu: According to this explanation from Sepharial, "Judah" == Midheaven.]

pg. 111

Technique of thought-reading (or resolution of questions) by numbers:

The mind having been fixed upon the question to be asked or the matter upon which information is sought, nine numbers are set down, to which 3 is added, and the numbers in the sun is then referred to for the nature of the question.  

Then look up the answer in the table given on pages 111 to 118.  

pg. 120

Technique given for locating lost things by numbers.  See table on pages 120 to 126.

pg. 129

The decimal system of enumeration, which proceeds from one to nine, was an implicit recognition of the law of cyclic recurrence.  The Hebrews may be said to think in twelves but count in tens.  

According to Kabalism of cyclic law, all events are in terms of 9.  

pg. 130

For any number reduced to its unit value, the addition of the number 9 to the original number will produce the same unit value.  Hence, in the conception of those who see significance in numbers, the application of any factor to this cyclic series must have some special pointing.  

Such a factor is to be found in the numerical value of a person's name.  And this, when applied tot he year in which that person was born, or in which any great crisis was reached, is found to have a kabalistic significance when reduced to terms of the Tarot.  [Examples given.]

pg. 131

The cyclic recurrence of certain like incidents observed in several cases appears to have led to the construction of what are called "Alfridary"/"Alfridaries".

pg. 132

Description and example is given. 

pg. 133

Sepharial says Alfridary/Alfridaries do not work!

Mendelieff has shown the atomic weights of the elements follow the natural octave.

pg. 134

Sir William Crookes, whose 'Genesis of the Elements' develop the same idea in regard to the differentiation of the protyle via the hydrogen base by a graduation of the vibration frequency and a proportionate diminishing of the mean free path or play-space of the various atoms.  

In human life, we observe that there is a tendency of any action to automatically repeat itself, so that what was a primarily voluntary act tends to fall into the region of the automatic, and so become a habit.  

Periodic law is another name for numerical sequence.  We call it a law because it responds to a numerical sequence, not because we pretend to an understanding of its causation.  

Lunations and eclipses run in cycles, as also do the conjunctions and the oppositions of the planets of the system.  There is a 19-year cycle of the lunation, at the end of which they recur in the same part of the zodiac -- that is to say, at the same distance from the equinox on the same day of the year.  If any effects of a physical nature can be rightly attributed to the combined action of the luminaries, then such effects will follow a cyclic repetition every nineteen years.  The phenomenon of the tides is an example.  

pg. 134, 135

Conjunctions and oppositions of other bodies are cyclical too and have their effects:

Mars and Mercury:   conjunctions in the same part of the zodiac every 79 years.
Saturn and Mars:    conjunctions in the same part of the zodiac every 30 years.
Jupiter and Saturn: conjunctions in the same part of the zodiac every 60 years.
etc.

pg. 136

Comets and star showers have a great effect also.  Their great velocity must produce terrific perturbations in spactial ether, and that these these visitants affect our atmosphere is evident from their luminosity.  Similarly, they may produce great heat and consequent drought and famine, and also they may affect men's minds.  

pg. 137.

Comets and star showers may be symbols or signs by which something we do not quite understand is signalled to us by the Great Intelligence.  If we study them we may find out their meaning.  

If Nature is the book of God, and the revelation of God to man, then, by the deciphering of natural symbols, we may arrive at an understanding of the divine language, the will and intention it expresses, and the purpose of creation with which God has been trying to impress us through the ages.  

Eventually we may find that in the study of the universal language we are realizing ourselves, entering into the history and future of our own evolution, and then it will appear that cosmic laws are human laws, as well economic and social as moral and spiritual, and that the universe is man, the embodiment of divine thought, the expression of a perfect geometry, a complex mathematical formula which, when resolved will be found to follow the numerical resolution:

1/7 = 0.142857
2/7 = 0.285714
3/7 = 0.428571
4/7 = 0.571428
5/7 = 0.714285
6/7 = 0.857142
  1 = 0.999999 to infinity (i.e. a recurring decimal in terms of unity.)

pg. 138

Every man is, in fine, a Number.  He is embodied number.  That is to say, the mass-chord of his whole constitution is in terms of a signle digit, to which he answers in the gamut of life.  

Sepharial references the "Minor Key" Kabala system which is given on page 9.


If the name of a person should appear too slender an argument for differences of faculty and function, differences of fortune and of character, then let the date of birth stand as symbol of the man (in regard to his dominant characteristics and faculty).  [rluu: Name takes precedence, then date.]



Key number of an individual is: The result of adding together the day, month, and year of birth.  

pg. 141

rluu: An example of a date and time of birth is given, and a number is derived from that information, but I don't know how Sepharial got that number.  


Mention of the kabala of the 'Table of Three'.  

[rluu: This table was never introduced... is it just the numerical unit value of the sum of the day, month, and year of birth?]

pg. 142

Knowing a person's number, a man may make numerical selections in his environment which will reinforce and uphold his effectiveness.  

pg. 144

Nature has more regard to potentiality than to potency, to future possibilities than to present circumstance. Consequently, we find that nature's expressions of value are not fixed, but have always a cumulative adjunct represented by +x^n, which we understand to mean indefinite evolution -- as, for example, Adam = 1 + 4 + 4 = 9 + x^n.

[rluu: Conceptually, this might be kind of like putting the base of the Square of 144 at a certain number on a stock chart.  In this case, using 'Adam' as 9, the base would be at 9.  (This is just my guess at interpreting what Sepharial is trying to say).]

pg. 146

Suggestion is given by several authors that nothing exists for us save in our consciousness, all things being related to use through our senses and our thoughts.  Whatever affects the consciousness affects the man, and in an intimate sense IS man.  This is the idea of all Nature being a "disguised humanity".

It is not what man has, but what he wants, that shapes his course and determines his efforts.  

In a universe where everything is in a state of flux, where the status quo is an unstable equilibrium, we find that reaction is the law.  For every rise there is a fall, for every flow an ebb, for every perihelion an aphelion, for every flood a drought.  

Law of action and reaction, which is responsible for the stability of the universe.

Earth's number is 4 (materiality).  
The Moon, has numbers 7 (increasing moon) and 2 (decreasing moon).  

In 1898, there was war between Spain and the United States.  This was causedby Saturn in Sagittarius (Spain being ruled by Sagittarius).  1898 = 1 + 8 + 9 + 8 = 26 = 8 (Saturn).

pg. 149

Russo-Japanese war took place in 1905, and coincided with the Saturn transit through Aquarius (Russia's ruling sign is Aquarius).  Mars was also transiting that sign.  

Portugal's ruling sign is Pisces.  The Saturn transit through Pisces gave trouble to Portugal.  

Securities (stocks) in these countries during their Saturn transit are depressed.

Oedipus Judaicus by William Drummond: 
In the book, Drummond seeks possible sources of the Biblical writings, from the Temple of Denderah to parallels with the Roman gods, dealing primarily with the 49th chapter of Genesis and the book of Joshua to draw his conclusions.

Authors that talked about zodiacal symbolism in relation to the great epochs of human history:
C. Massey
E. V. Kenealy
J Mackay
Capt. Drayton

In each of these, some glimpeses of the system of interpretation are to be found.

pg. 152

It is the recurrence of planetary periods, and luni-solar cycles that constitutes the ebb and flow of human affairs and the corresponding changes or fluctuations in values.  

Cycle lengths:

Saturn: 30 years
Jupiter: 12 years
Mars: 15 years
Sun: 19 years
Venus: 8 years
Mercury: 10 years
Moon: 4 years

The Saros or eclipse cycle is 18 years 10 and 1/2 days.
3 eclipse cycles amounts to 54 years 1 month.
36 eclipse cycles amounts to 649 years, after which the eclipses begin again and recur on the same days of the year.  

There is marked physical effects due to, and coincident with the central eclipse, especially when the Moon is in perigee (nearest distance from the Earth).  

pg. 153

Whenever an eclipse of either luminary falls on any of these points (Asc., Desc., MC, IC), a period of sickness, depression of fortune, loss and disaster, will follow.    Such period commencing as many days from the date of eclipse as the luminary is degrees from the horizon it last crossed, whether East or West, and the duration being equal to four times the number of days that hte luminary is distant in degrees from the horizon to which it is proceeding.  

[Examples given in the text.]

pg. 155

Saturn, as privation, threatens the life every 7 or 8 years, by its quadrature, but more especially every 15 years by its conjunction and opposition.  Jupiter gives increase and expansion every 4th year, and more especially every 12th year.  

Events that characterized any particular month are apt to find repetition every 19th year in the same month of the year becuase hte lunations repeat themselves after 19 years about the same date, and are therefore in the same horoscopical relations as 19years previously.  This law of "correlated successiveness", as it has been called, is the means employed by nature to preserve the equilibrium of things and regulate the law of values.  It gives rise to diversity of fortune.

pg. 156

In the study of the law of values, we find that a number signifies a definite characteristic, but does not indicate anything concerning the manner of its expression.  

The key to interpretation of any number, or corresponding planet, is one of the arcana of kabalistic and astrological science which have been successfully applied to the question of values for many years past (markets on monthly and daily timeframe also), which in every way confirms the view of Kepler concerning the concurrence of mundane events with changes occurring in the heavens.  

pg. 159

Law of compensation.
(Aphelion alternates to Perihelion).

pg. 159, 160.

The laws of periodicity, of cyclic progress and of gravitation, ensure the working out of the law of compensation, and this is the basis of our law of values which here has been partially considered.  We learn from the law of values that rise and fall, increase and decrease, gain and loss, are only relative and at most but temporary terms, having no permanent value in a scheme that demands continual progress.  

pg. 160

What I have here tried to show is the fact that 1 = 1 + X^n , and 8 = 3 [rluu: I believe that balanced Saturn and Jupiter qualities are meant here.].  

pg. 162

Bruno was the originator of the Doctrine of Correspondences which was afterwards and perhaps more patiently illustrated by Swedenborg.  The Nolan philosopher was an originator of the Hermetic doctrine "As above, so below," for he affirmed that the smallest thinkable body is a mirror of the universe.  

As to the Doctrine of Correspondences, we have this formula from him: What harmony is to the universe, so is virtue to the individual and social law to the community.  What light is to the stars, so is intelligence to the spirit and science to humanity.  Here we have the correspondences of harmony, virtue, and social law.  Also of the universe, the individual, and humanity.  

pg. 163

Further, he shows that the mathematical point (intellectual), the physical atom, and the spiritual monad are correspondences.  

Sun is the manifestation to us of the divine Wisdom and Love.  

pg. 166

Number is implicit in all the works of the Spirit.  

pg. 167

The Supreme Mind and Will is embodied and expressed in Nature, and the study of natural phenomena must therefore be our guide to true religion. 

In a manifest universe, there is no such thing as an absolute standard, everything is relative.  

pg. 168

Angle of Parallax is explained.  
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallax

pg. 169

Relative truths are all that we can hope for in regard to anything in this universe, since everythign is conditioned by our own consciousness and sense-limitations, but the relations of our perceptions should nevertheless be true.


pg. 171

Leibniz's monadology constituted an essential part of Bruno's philosopy.

If now we take the idea of continuity in matter, we shall find that it can only be worked out on the principle of the hexagon.  No toher form is capable of affording contact with an equal number of units of the same form and size as itself.  There is a magic in the number Six, which enters freely into all Nature.  Water, for exmple, crystallizes at an angle of 60 degrees, which is 1/6th of a circle.  Water was held among the Theurgists to be the prime base of all this world's evolutions.

Defintion of Theurgy from wikipedia:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theurgy

Theurgy describes the practice of rituals, sometimes seen as magical in nature, performed with the intention of invoking the action or evoking the presence of one or more gods, especially with the goal of uniting with the divine, achieving henosis, and perfecting oneself.


pg. 172

The interlaced equilateral triangles illustrates the sacred nature of the number Six.  It may be convenient to regard all matter from the point of view that the atom is a hexahedron rather than a sphere.  

pg. 173

Six:   The number representing Creation.

Seven: The number having dignity and the significance of divine attributes.
It was the point within the triangles, the center of the hexagon, which by existence constituted a unifying factor and gave it a particular virtue.  Hermetic philosophers used Seven to indicate the totality of things.  It became related to the Sabbath, and was used to signify fulness and completion.  

So a week was made to consist of seven days, and a great cycle of seven millenniums.  They symbolized the solar system under a glyph, which employed the seven planetary bodies known at that time.  [rluu: See diagram on pg. 173 for how they are drawn in the star-of-david shape.]

pg. 174

The symbols were repeated in the seven lamps and the branches of the golden candlestick.  The septenary idea is indigenous to the Hebraic system, and is found in evidence at all stages of its development, from the Chaldean conception of Creation to the establishing of the Covenant and the building of hte Temple.  

St. Paul bears testimony to the seven planets in speaking of the ordinances of Moses and the construction of the Tabernacle, which he says was ordained "after the pattern of things in the heavens."  The leper was told by Elijah to wash himself seven times in the river Jordan -- a cryptic symbol of the Gilgaluth or cyclic law of rebirth, the name Jordan signifying the River of Knowledge.  

David the King prays that his soul may be "tried as silver is tried and seven times purified in the furnace of earth."  For it appears tha thte Hebrews believed that incarnations were necessary until the seven stages of purification had been effected.  The furnace of earth is of course the material body, and the silver thrown into it for the purpose of purification is the human soul, typified by the Moon, which rules silver.  

pg. 174, 175

Similarly, we have the perfection of things indicated by stages of seven times seven, which is the Hebrew jubilee -- though for some reason unknown we have adopted the custom of celebrating the jubilee at the end of the fiftieth year, instead of the end of the forty-ninth or begining of the fiftieth, -- and we find that "seven times seven" and "seventy times seven" are numbers taht indicate completeness and perfection, a Sabbath of Sabbaths.  Thus the Israelites are represented as having passed around the walls of Jericho seven times each day for seven days, after which they celebrated the jubilee (horn-blowing).

In connection with the subject of Gilgaluth, or cyclic revolutions of the human soul, we have to employ the symbols of the Sun and Moon as representing spirit and matter, or the natural elements of fire and water.  

Numbers of the Sun and Moon:
Sun: 36
Moon: 28

Multiplied together yields: 
36 * 28 = 1008

1008 is a number of considerable astronomical importance.

1/7th of 1008 is 144, which is the number of the Man "of the fulness of the stature of Christ".  "Adam" in hebrew is A1, D4, M4, or 144, which is 12 * 12, the measure of the New Jerusalem.  

Thus we see how the One is manifest in the Six nd how the One working in and through the Six produces the fulness of perfection and the "fulfilling of the law."  The potentiality of all things is therefore in the One, the phenomenal manifestation in the Six.

pg. 176

The value of Pi = 3.14159 is contained in the sum of an age, a year, and a day of Brahma.

pg. 177

Hindu conception of ages:
Satya Yuga: 1,728,000 years
Treta Yuga: 1,296,000 years
Dvapara Yuga: 854,000 years
Kali Yuga: 432,000 years

Total years: 4,320,000 solar years.

Great Year of Plato: 25,920 years

These large time periods have common factors, and are linked together through astronomy. 


The Hindu conception of ages is formed on the numerical progression of: 1 2 3 4 = 10.  The sum is 10 times the first age (Kali Yuga).


The basis can be found in the number 72, which is the number of years in which the precession of the equinoxes amounts to one degree of the ecliptic.  There are 60 minutes in 1 degree and 60 * 72 = 4320.

pg. 178

Naros cycle: 600 years

600 years * 12 manifestations of the Deity = 7200 years
7200 years * 60 = 432,000 years (i.e. length of Kali Yuga).


360 degrees * 12 zodiac signs = 25,920 years in precession / 6
360 * 12 = 25920 / 6

pg. 180

The proportional vectors of the planets, excepting Mercury, etc., are given on the basis of a progression of (3 * (2^(n-2)) + 4), from which we see that the Earth equals 10.  Neptune is omitted from this series, but it may be added by doubling the figures for Uranus and adding 4, thus 192 * 2 = 384, to which 4 being added, we get 388 as the value for Neptune.  

pg. 181

Puranic concept of the Laya Centres or vortices from which the worlds are evolved.

Seer of Patmos.

pg. 183

Stages of evolution:
Igneous, gaseous, fluidic, mineral, vegetable, animal, human.

pg. 185

Characteristics of Uranus and Neptune are given.

Uranus is a higher octave of Mercury.
Neptune is a higher octave of Venus.

pg. 186

The "Secret Doctrine" says that Uranus is the same as the Sun, for which the latter is a substitute.  

pg. 187

Thus we could get a new system of enumeration:

Sun = 1
Lilith = 2
Jupiter = 3
Uranus = 4
Mercury = 5
Venus = 6
Moon = 7
Saturn = 8
Mars = 9
Neptune (as the alternate of Jupiter and the higher Venus) = 6

[rluu: I believe Sepharial is pointing to the planet-number assignments on pg. 188 as being more correct.]

pg. 188

Keeping negative value of Sun as 4, and maintaining the Uranus and Neptune as higher octaves of Mercury and Venus, we would have the following:

1 = Sun
2 = Lilith
3 = Jupiter
4 = Sun (negative)
5 = Mercury
6 = Venus
7 = Moon
8 = Saturn
9 = Mars
14 = Uranus
15 = Neptune

[rluu: Sepharial elaborates more on Lilith; see my notes for page 193.]

pg. 189

The "full stature of Christ" is kabalistically represented by the square of 12, or 144, the enumeration of the name of the primal ancestor, or of that race of humanity which became "sons of God" by the inbreathing of the Spirit.

pg. 191

The psyche is the child of Spirit and Matter.  Traced to their source, these two, Spirit and Matter, must be regarded as essentially one, although in some systems of speculative philosophy, the one (Matter) is regarded as a reflection of the other.  

pg. 191, 192

About consciousness:

We observe one cosmic energy or life working through a variety of states of matter to the production of various kinds of forces, and we understand that essentially all matter is identical, but apparently different by reason of a variety of characteristics produced in the process known as differentiation.  The various stages at which energy is arrested by matter appear to answer to states of consciousness in man, for all consciousness appears to be the result of resistance.  If we take an etheric vibration or an electric current and set up resistance to it, we shall get light as the result.  By slowing this down again we get a partial conversion into heat, and by further resistance we institute the phenomenon of combustion.  The descent of the monad through the successive planes of matter thus gives rise to successive states of consciousness from the various degrees of resistance set up by the material conditions through which it passes.  


Thus it is that Vulcan = Mars = Will.

And we see Saturn 8, the symbol of restriction is the cause of transition to Jupiter 3, which is the symbol of expansion, and finally to 9 Mars, which is freedom. 

pg. 193

2 is the value for Lilith.  In the tradition of the Kabalists, Lilith was the first wife of Adam, who was changed into a night spectre in consequence of her refractory conduct.  She is described as especially inimical to women and children and from all accounts appears somewhat akin to th hag known as the Banshee, the apparition of whom in any house is certain disaster to its occupants.  

Cosmically, Lilith is the second or rather the first satellite of the Earth (Adam), and is no longer a luminous body, but revolves still about the Earth in an orbit at a mean distance of 1,040,000 miles in 119 days.  The satllite Lilith is only visible to us under certain conditions, namely, when at a particular angular distance or elongation from the Sun and at the time of its transit over the disc.  The synodical revolution of the planet is 177 days.  [In the book, dates are given by various observers of spot (Lilith) obscuring the Sun.]  The satellite travels 534 degrees in 177 days, which gives a mean diurnal motion of about 3 degrees, and a period of revolution of 119 days.  The orbit of it is eccentric due to the pull of the Sun.

pg. 197

Per Kabalists and astrologers:
"The Sun is the father and the Moon the mother of every mundane event."

pg. 198

Goethe called architecture "frozen music".

Plato defined the Deity as the Great Geometer.

The universe has been variously described as "the vestment of God," the "bodying-forth of divine Thought," and "divine Ideation in expression of form."

pg. 199

Everywhere on all sides, and in an almost inifinite variety of forms, behonds the Trinity of Life, Substance and Intelligence expressed as force, matter, and consciousness.  

pg. 201

The universe is only intelligible because it is an expression of Intelligence.  Its intelligibility lies in the fact that it responds to the law of numbers, whence we may argue that numbers are the means employed for the expression of the Divine Intelligence.  The facts fully maintain this view.  

Law of Kepler says that the planets describe equal areas in equal times by their motions around the Sun, and hence it follows that the squares of the periodic times of the planets are to each other as the cubes of their mean distances from the Sun.  

From this, we see that the universe itself is governed by mechnical laws which are intelligible, and therefore are expressions of Intelligence.  We see, also, that this Intelligence is expressed in terms of numbers, whcih we use to signify quantitative relations.  

pg. 202, 203

Adam, the perfect man, made in the image and likeness of the Elohim, is enumerated thus: 1a 4d 4m = 144 = 9.  Adam means red.  It is also the Hebrew number of "the fulness of stature", or 12 x 12.  Symbolism connects the number 9 with Mars.  

pg. 203

Expansiveness is characterized by 3; as convenient, indeed, as the geometrical formula (pi * (a^2)), for the area of a circle.

Our relations to the external world answer to numerical law. 

pg. 204

Geometrical law operates in creation and ordering of the cosmos.  There is also a geometrical law of thought imposed upon humanity.
