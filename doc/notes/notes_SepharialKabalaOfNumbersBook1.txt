rluu 20120626: I took 3 pages of paper notes on this book.  The below notes are a continuation of that starting from page 17.

pg. 19
Our thought, which is three-dimensional, is capable of generating from the evolutions of a point these figures -- the sphere, the cone, and the cube; and their superficial equivalents -- the circle, the triangle, and the square; with their perverts -- the oblong and the ellipse.  

These figures have always been used in symbolical thought to represent states of consciousness.  

But we are only concerned with them as related to the numbers 1, 3, 4.  These are denoted and connected as follows:

1 : God                                : Osiris
3 : Humanity [spirit, soul, and body]  : Horus
4 : Nature                             : Isis

pg. 20
The cross represents matter, which is the cube unfolded.  

All geometrical relations are expressions of numerical ratios.  

Numbers don't have any qualities or virtues of their own, but that they acquire such by reason of their quantitive relations to the causative world, which is the world of thought.  A number is a seal or impress of natural law as surely as is the shape of a flower, the sound of an atmospheric vibration, the color of an etheric wave.  The significance of a number answers to definite archetypal or noumenal relations.  

pg. 22
There is a system of interpretation in numerology which is supported by experience, but has its origin beyond the realm of phenomenal world.  This is used in divination.  

The laws of thoguht imposed on us by nature:
Sun   : Circle    : 1
Moon  : Triangle  : 3
Earth : Plus sign : 4

as by the most complex demonstration of the 'Principia' of Newton or the three laws of Kepler.  

pg. 23
All symbols, i.e. ideographs, are geometrical expressions of thought.  So figures are expressions of numbers, as numbers are of quantitive relations.  

pg. 25
If it is true that Pythagoras said: 
"The world is built upon the power of numbers," then numbers must be the key to understanding of the world.  

pg. 26
Some systems use literal values, i.e. the numerical power of letters, and other by the sound by or phonetic values.  Example of each is given on pg. 26.
Table of letter values is on page 30.  Another phonetic example is given on page 35.  

pg. 27
Many people have used with great success, the values attached to numbers by the Tarot.  Reference to book: "The Key to the Tarot", by A. E. Waite.  London.  

The 22 Major Keys are given briefly on page 27.

pg. 30
Hebraic, Pythagorean and phonetic values are given.

pg. 31
The ancient writers veiled their secrets by employed one of three methods:

a) The Temurah: Letters of a word were replaced by others after a definite method.  They first wrote the alphabet in three lines, representing the units, tens, and hundreds.  These lines, each of nine letters, were divided again into three groups, making 9 in all.  Any letter falling in the same group could be interchanged with another in the same group.  

b) Gimetria: This was an arithmetical method by which each word was replaced by another having the same numerical value.  

c) Notaricon: Selection was made of certain letters according to the rules of the art, these letters being taking from teh beginning, middle, or end of the words in a sentence, so as to produce a single word from their combination.  

pg. 31, 32
Finally, they had a secret writing, which was based upon the Temurah.  The pythagorean alphabet is used in connection with the interpretation employed in that system.  In this system, every number up to 50, rising thence by 10's to 100, has a definite signification; and every succeeding hundred has a separate meaning.  To these original interpretations others of a fanciful nature have since been added, as 365 = "astronomy and astrology"; and 666 = "enmity, secret plots, maliciousness" because of its use in the Apocalypse as the number or name of The Beast, when in fact, which as James Pryse has shown, meant no more than the animal mind -- i.e. the natural or lower intelligence of the average man.  The table of values are given on page 32 to 34.

Example of the use of this technique is shown on page 34.  

pg. 38, 39
System employing the Hebrew values of letters to a person's signature.  See page 39.  

pg. 40
Two techniques given for determing the signature of the year:

1) The signature of each year can be obtained by adding the key number to the current year, and then reducing, and then checking the Tarot card corresponding to that value.  

2) The signature of each year can be obtained by adding the age of the person to the current year.  The value reduced and checked against the Tarot corresponding to that value.  

pg. 41 through 53 showing the use of the 3 by 3 square with numbers, and examples.  [rluu: In the examples, I haven't figured out exactly how he is getting the planets he is getting.  Some of the combinations with planets that I think should be there for the technique I think he is doing, he does not list sometimes.]

pg. 43
The technique is to take the date on which a person is born, emploing always the date at noon preceding the hour of birth, for this is the true solar date, bing 12 hours behind the secular date.  Thus, 26th June, at 5:40 pm = 26th, while 26th June at 9:00 am === 25th.  

pg. 45, 46
Table of numbers and their meanings are given for this system:

1. Stands for individuality, domination, egotism. 
2. Flexibility, change, instability, traveling.  
3. Expansion, increase, growth, opulence, congestion, riches. 
4. Realization, materiality, practical results, pride, ostentation.  
5. Intellection, learning, activity, commerce, language, science.  
6. Art, poetry, music, the social accomplishments, affection, love, sympathy.
7. Psychic force, influence, popularity, voyages, adaptability, versatility, progress.  
8. Corruption, disease, death, decay, loss, hurt, imperfection, obstruction, privation.  
9. Freedom, energy, keenness, acumen, zeal, penetration, fire, fever.
