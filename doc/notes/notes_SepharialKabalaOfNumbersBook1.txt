Notes on the book "The Kabala Of Numbers, Book 1", by Sepharial

rluu 20120626: I took 3 pages of paper notes on this book.  The below notes are a continuation of that starting from page 17.

pg. 19
Our thought, which is three-dimensional, is capable of generating from the evolutions of a point these figures -- the sphere, the cone, and the cube; and their superficial equivalents -- the circle, the triangle, and the square; with their perverts -- the oblong and the ellipse.  

These figures have always been used in symbolical thought to represent states of consciousness.  

But we are only concerned with them as related to the numbers 1, 3, 4.  These are denoted and connected as follows:

1 : God                                : Osiris
3 : Humanity [spirit, soul, and body]  : Horus
4 : Nature                             : Isis

pg. 20
The cross represents matter, which is the cube unfolded.  

All geometrical relations are expressions of numerical ratios.  

Numbers don't have any qualities or virtues of their own, but that they acquire such by reason of their quantitive relations to the causative world, which is the world of thought.  A number is a seal or impress of natural law as surely as is the shape of a flower, the sound of an atmospheric vibration, the color of an etheric wave.  The significance of a number answers to definite archetypal or noumenal relations.  

pg. 22
There is a system of interpretation in numerology which is supported by experience, but has its origin beyond the realm of phenomenal world.  This is used in divination.  

The laws of thoguht imposed on us by nature:
Sun   : Circle    : 1
Moon  : Triangle  : 3
Earth : Plus sign : 4

as by the most complex demonstration of the 'Principia' of Newton or the three laws of Kepler.  

pg. 23
All symbols, i.e. ideographs, are geometrical expressions of thought.  So figures are expressions of numbers, as numbers are of quantitive relations.  

pg. 25
If it is true that Pythagoras said: 
"The world is built upon the power of numbers," then numbers must be the key to understanding of the world.  

pg. 26
Some systems use literal values, i.e. the numerical power of letters, and other by the sound by or phonetic values.  Example of each is given on pg. 26.
Table of letter values is on page 30.  Another phonetic example is given on page 35.  

pg. 27
Many people have used with great success, the values attached to numbers by the Tarot.  Reference to book: "The Key to the Tarot", by A. E. Waite.  London.  

The 22 Major Keys are given briefly on page 27.

pg. 30
Hebraic, Pythagorean and phonetic values for the letters and numbers are given.

pg. 31
The ancient writers veiled their secrets by employed one of three methods:

a) The Temurah: Letters of a word were replaced by others after a definite method.  They first wrote the alphabet in three lines, representing the units, tens, and hundreds.  These lines, each of nine letters, were divided again into three groups, making 9 in all.  Any letter falling in the same group could be interchanged with another in the same group.  

b) Gimetria: This was an arithmetical method by which each word was replaced by another having the same numerical value.  

c) Notaricon: Selection was made of certain letters according to the rules of the art, these letters being taking from teh beginning, middle, or end of the words in a sentence, so as to produce a single word from their combination.  

pg. 31, 32
Finally, they had a secret writing, which was based upon the Temurah.  The pythagorean alphabet is used in connection with the interpretation employed in that system.  In this system, every number up to 50, rising thence by 10's to 100, has a definite signification; and every succeeding hundred has a separate meaning.  To these original interpretations others of a fanciful nature have since been added, as 365 = "astronomy and astrology"; and 666 = "enmity, secret plots, maliciousness" because of its use in the Apocalypse as the number or name of The Beast, when in fact, which as James Pryse has shown, meant no more than the animal mind -- i.e. the natural or lower intelligence of the average man.  The table of values are given on page 32 to 34.

Example of the use of this technique is shown on page 34.  

pg. 38, 39
System employing the Hebrew values of letters to a person's signature.  See page 39.  The procedure is not as clearly explained here, but it is explained on page 62, with an example on page 63.  

pg. 40
Two techniques given for determing the signature of the year:

1) The signature of each year can be obtained by adding the key number to the current year, and then reducing, and then checking the Tarot card corresponding to that value.  

2) The signature of each year can be obtained by adding the age of the person to the current year.  The value reduced and checked against the Tarot corresponding to that value.  

pg. 41 through 53 showing the use of the 3 by 3 square with numbers, and examples.  [rluu: In the examples, I haven't figured out exactly how he is getting the planets he is getting.  Some of the combinations with planets that I think should be there for the technique I think he is doing, he does not list sometimes.]

pg. 43
The technique is to take the date on which a person is born, emploing always the date at noon preceding the hour of birth, for this is the true solar date, bing 12 hours behind the secular date.  Thus, 26th June, at 5:40 pm = 26th, while 26th June at 9:00 am === 25th.  

pg. 45, 46
Table of numbers and their meanings are given for this system:

1. Stands for individuality, domination, egotism. 
2. Flexibility, change, instability, traveling.  
3. Expansion, increase, growth, opulence, congestion, riches. 
4. Realization, materiality, practical results, pride, ostentation.  
5. Intellection, learning, activity, commerce, language, science.  
6. Art, poetry, music, the social accomplishments, affection, love, sympathy.
7. Psychic force, influence, popularity, voyages, adaptability, versatility, progress.  
8. Corruption, disease, death, decay, loss, hurt, imperfection, obstruction, privation.  
9. Freedom, energy, keenness, acumen, zeal, penetration, fire, fever.  

pg. 54
Sepharial says the system of numerical kabalism he is here unfolding is linked up with other subjects through an astrological tradition. 
[rluu: "Here" as in in this chapter or as in in this book?  The current chapter spans from pages 54 to 61.]

Numbers have a signification or symbolical value irrespective of:
a) Our recognition of their symbolism
b) What we are led to recognize as natural causation.

Law of permutations: ((2^n) - 1)

Thus, possible combinations of any three principles, sounds, or colors, = 2 x 2 x 2 - 1 = 7.

You may or may not read the signal, but that does not in any way alter either the law expressed by the formula or the truth of the expression.  

[rluu: Sepharial emphasizes this as if it is extremely important.]
[rluu: Is 'n' in the formula the number of letters?  Or perhaps the birth name or birth date numbers, or maybe the Sun position at birth?]

pg. 55
Sepharial has already affirmed the universe as a symbol.  It exists, and has existed for immense ages as a symbol.  Symbol is the language of nature.  

After the Triune Deity, the ancients placed the seven great powers or archangels.  "The One produced the Three, the Three produced the seven.  These ten are all things."

[rluu: Where is this quote from?  What is this quote saying?]

Scorpio, has associated symbols Serpentarius and Draconis, nocturnal, poisonful, and death-dealing.  

After the 7th day of creation or unfoldment, death makes its appearance in teh world.  That is to say after the universe has attained its fullness of evolution, it will begin to devolve.


There is no natural sequence between the number 8 and the things that number signifies to us [sinister and unfortunate things, death, decay, ruin]. We may affirm that it [rluu: the number 8?] exists apart from natural causation, for there is no causative relation between the occurrence of a number in a man's name or the date of his birth, and any event or characteristic we may associate with such a number.  
[rluu: Note that Bayer says on pg. 64 of "Time Factors In The Stock Market" that "Everything is alive; what we call death, equalling definite destruction, cannot be found in this world.  All is change, revolution, return, evolution."]


pg. 57
In this kabalism system, the ancients had a conception of the relations of man to the universe, calling him, in fact, the microcosm.  They divided the microcosm into four principles:

1) The imperishable soul, which reflected the Trinity of Deific Powers. (Venus & Mercury).
2) The rational soul.
3) The animal soul.
4) The gross body.

These they related to the cosmic bodies, conceiving them to be enveloped by an aura which defined their sphere of action and maintained their relationship, just as they held that the solar system was limited by a crystalline sphere.  

The cosmos was thus completed, the surrounding and enfolding sphere of Jupiter, which they called the auric body.  

pg. 59

The sum of the numbers (1 through 9) is 45 = 15 * 3.  The triple name [Hebrew word for "Jah", see book pg. 59], in the understanding of which we are exhorted to praise.  

[rluu: Is this "3" here the 3 days and 3 nights of the Jonah riddle?  Thus 3 days and 3 nights would be 90 degrees?]

[rluu: 
From http://www.greateststoryevertold.org/jah.html
Jah (Yahh in Hebrew)
is a contraction of the root word Jehovah (Yehovah in Hebrew),meaning "the existing one", the proper name of the one true God. This is the only time Jah is used in the King James Version of the Bible. This word is used and translated as LORD 45 other times in the Old Testament, KJV.

From http://concordances.org/hebrew/3050.htm
Yah: the name of the God of Israel
Original Word: יָהּ
Part of Speech: Proper Name
Transliteration: Yah
Phonetic Spelling: (yaw)
Short Definition: LORD
Definition: the name of the God of Israel
NASB Translation: GOD (1), LORD (49).
]

The planetary forms (for the numbers):
9: Associated with all sharp, keen, and pointed things, such as are made of steel and iron, spears, lances, scalpels, swords, knives, flints, tongues of flame, etc.
8: Symbol fo involution, and represents all serpentine adn scroll forms, the convolute [spiral] and double convolute [2 spirals in the shape of a backward 'S'], the letter s, and all sibilant sounds, as in hissing.  
7: Represented by crescent forms, dexter curves, and horned shapes.  
6: Associated with symmetrical and well-formed bodies, graceful curves and rounded figures, in which symmetry and balance are the prevailing feature.  
5: Related to sharp but disjointed forms, articulations, links and jointed bodies.  
4: Connected with square bodies, rectangles, crosses, and horizontal lines.  
3: With triangles, tripodds, and bodies having three divisions; also with integumenta, envelopes, and spheroids, ovals, and bodies capable of expansion and contraction.  
2: Number associated with sinister curves, forms having round bases, as bowls, vases, etc., parallels and pairs of things, such as pillars, etc.
1: represents upright columns, monoliths, spheres, circles, perpendicular lines, and orifices.  

pg. 60

The colors associated with the planets, numbers, and forms, are:
9: Red or crimson
8: Black or deep brown
7: Silver or opalescence
6: Pale blue or turquoise.
5: Indigo or dark blue.
4: Orange or ruddy gold.
3: Violet.
2: Yellow or cream.
1: White.

The notes, or sounds answering ot hte planetary and therefore alos the numerical powers, and their appropriate colors, are as follows:

C : Sun     : 1 or 4
D : Saturn  : 8
E : Mercury : 5
F : Moon    : 7 or 2
G : Mars    : 9
A : Venus   : 6
B : Jupiter : 3


Sepharial says that he is certain that Shakespeare was neither Kabalist or Rosicrucian, but he employs knowledge of both faculties.  

pg. 61.
Deitic height of evolution is up to: 
6 + 9 = 15
which we need not aspire, contenting ourselves by "filling up the spaces in between".  
[rluu: Is this the breakdown of a day in the Jonah 3 days and 3 nights riddle?]

pg. 62, 63
System shown for analyzing the name according to the Kabala, using the 22 Major Keys of Tarot.  This is the same method as shown on pg. 38, 39, but with a better explanation.  On page 62 and 63 however, he does not explicitly mention that the method be applied only to a signature.  Example is given on page 63.  

pg. 62.
Each of the Tarotic numbers has a fourfold interpretation:
1) spiritual
2) intellectual
3) psychic
4) physical
The correspondence of which running from the world of principles to that of causes, thence to the world of effects, terminating in teh world of ultimates, which is the concrete world of physical phenomena.  

Sepharial says he gives the full interpreation of the twenty two Major Keys of the Tarot in his 'Manual of Occultism'.
