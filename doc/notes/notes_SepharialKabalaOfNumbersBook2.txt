pg. 9

Triangle is the symbol of Father, Mother and Child.  
Sun as Father
Moon as Mother
Earth as Son


pg. 10
Known by the Egyptians as Osiris, Isis, and Horus.

pg. 12
One of the most intricate problems that have been handed down to us from antiquity:
7 divided by two, is split into 3 and 4.

pg. 13, 14
The number 9 is associated with Vulcan, as Humanity.  It is associated with Mars and the color red, the symbol of desire.  

pg. 14, 15
Desire is the root of all action, and is the fire that, acting on the fluidic body, is responsible for all forms of emotion.  Desire it is that binds us and desire that sets us free.

pg. 17, 18
Significance is attached to the numbers 3, 7, 12, and multiples of these, in all theologies.  

By a number of deft manipulations of figures, the Rabbinical experts were able to read an entirely new and mystical meaning into the Hebrew Scripture, and this they embodied in a work which was called Zohar.  But whereas they made use of three distinct forms of computation, they were faithful to the text and to the traditional values of the Hebrew letters, and also to their methods, so that it is surprising they should have evolved so perfect a system.  

pg. 18

It is open to us to believe either that the authors of the Scriptures deliberately planned the glyph and communicated the key to the Kabala, or that the writing of the Scripture was effected under the operation of the Law of Mind, which finds its interpretation in the mystical science of numbers.  

Having given a permanent value to the letters of the alphabet, teh consistent Kabalist proceededby three methods to give a new value to every word or group of letters, adn thus a new meaning to every sentence.  

By the 'Notaricon' method, he extracted the letters from teh beginning of words, from the ends of words and by a regular sequence thus obtained certain letters which, being brought together and divided into words, gave a new sentence that was not only intelligible in itself, but highly pertinent to the meaning of the text from which it was drawn.  

By 'Gemetria', he gave a value to each letter in a word and then reduced the whole word to its unit value, dealing thus successively with the words of the text, so that finally he had a number of figures which, being converted into letters gave an oracular key to the meaning of the text.  

pg. 19

By 'Temurah', he changed the letters of the text by the application of certain set rules embodied in the Table of Tziruph, so that a new interpretation of the text was open to him  

These three methods are illustrated in Sepharial's The Manual of Occultism.  

Whoever wrote the Bacon-Shakespeare plays, was a Rosicrucian and Kabalist, and an expert in the use of Kabalistic keys.  In a studied cryptogram of this nature, there was conscious purpose and experience.  The author [of the plays] had many models upon which to frame his cryptic sentences, for the secret writing of this sort had long been in use during times of wars and insurrection, and Kabalists continually use such means of conveying their teachings to those who are keen enough to perceive that an obscure sentence contains its own elucidation.  Sometimes a signal is given, as by some typographic error, peculiar spelling, or the use of an ambiguous word.  


pg. 20

In the 'Exodus', there are 3 consecutive verses, each consisting of 72 letters, which are used for conveying the names of the 72 Principalities known to Kabalists as the Shemhamphoroe, and they are each set overthe gates of the temple, six at each gate, and three gates upon each side -- one facing north, another south, one east, and another west.  Astrologers similarly divide the celestial circle into four quadrants, of three signs each, answering to the four quaters of the heavens; and each sign is again divided into three decans of 10 degrees each, and these are split into two of 5 degrees each, so that in all there are 4 x 3 x 3 x 2, or 72 'faces', as they are called, and each carries its own description and characteristics.

pg. 21

Law of correspondence.  

Numbers are the only key to understanding the universe's mysteries.  

pg. 22

Water crystallizes at an angle of 60 degrees.  We know the various angles at which the metals crystallize, but our science does not enable us to say why they preserve these angles. 
[rluu: The angles of various metals or elements may provide valuable clues.]

pg. 23

Hipparchus
Ptolemny
Kepler
Tycho
Newton
Kelvin

Number, as expressed in geometrical relations, is the most intimate expression of the Soul of things. 

pg. 27

It is an interesting fact that the superior metals crystallize at the angle or complemental angle of a regular polygon.

pg. 30

The key to the study of nature is Numbers -- ratios, quantitive relations, the geometry of things.  The ancient philosophers were more conservative in the use of numbers, which they used in a symbolical sense.  

Jacob Boehme makes use of numbers only in a mystical sense.
Eckhartshausen uses numbers in a symbolical sense.
Cagliostro, used numbers in a Kabalistic sense.  

Sepharial says it is in the Kabalistic sense that they have a practical value.

pg. 31

Previous experience along these occult lines of study has shown me that only those who are ready for the idea can apprehend and absorb it.  A good many can digest it, but very few assimilate it.  It does not enter into their constitution and become a part of themselves.  It fails to affect their beliefs and their view-point in life.  It is an adjunct, not a component of their mental being.  Knowing this, one does not overfeed them, nor put all the good things on the table at once.  

pg. 32

In what, then, consists our sense of harmony?  It is inherent in the soul of man, in his laws of thought, in the numerical constitution of his being.  According to his evolution and his position in the scale of being, he embodies and responds to a definite set of vibrations.  He apprehends number because he IS number.  The mass-chord of all personal vibrations may be taken as the man's physical constitution.  The mass-chord of all his emotional vibrations is the net result of his psychic constitution.  

pg. 33

The language we think and speak in, is the language of our individual natures, tastes, appeitites, desires, and aspirations.  

Each of us has a dominant note, color, number, or vibration, and answers to that note in others.  It has been referred to as a 'signature' by Jacob Boehme in his 'Signatura Rerum', and in this sense is a physiognomy imposed by nature.  

pg. 34

The four fixed signs of the zodiac which enter into the composition of the ancient symbols of the Assyrian Bull and the Egyptian Spinx, as well as the Hebrew Cherubim.  

Lion           : Fire  : Spiritual / Spirit : Light
Man            : Air   : Mental / Mind      : Light
Eagle (Dragon) : Water : Psychic            : Dark
Bull           : Earth : Physical           : Dark


Boehme makes them correspond with the four seasons and the four corners of the Earth, or cardinal points.  

Four corners of the Earth == cardinal points

pg. 35

Technique shown for reducing planet sign positions in a horoscope to number, according to their element, and then the reducing that to the mass-chord number.  

pg. 36

Seharial says we have to modify the values of planets according to the signs they are in, since the same colors light shining through a differently colored medium will appear differently.  For this reason certain numbers are ascribed by the Kabalists to the 12 signs and gates of heavens [see Cosmic Symbolism].

Sepharial mentions two techniques:

1) The number of the planet and sign being then multiplied togehter and reduced to its unit value, the mass-chord will be different for each combination of planetary influences, and the resultant signature will be one of hte nine digits.  

2) But a more convenient method of enumerating the planetary configurations is to multiply the planetary number by the numberof the planet whose sign it occupies and then to reduce it to a unit value.  

[rluu: Sepharial says "To those of my readers who are interested in numerical horoscopy will no doubt take the hint and follow it out to its proper conclusion."  Thus it sounds like he is making extra emphasis on the value of these techniques.]


Geometry of Nature finds expression in the individual solely because he is compounded of the cosmic elements and himself a reflex of all that he holds.  If a man looks into the mirror of nature fairly and squarely, he will inevitably see only himself.  


Every individual, hence, responds to a particular number -- the highest of which is Adam, 144 --> 9, made in the "image and likeness of God."  Now God here is the Logos of our solar system, and it is not to be argued that the key number of our system is that of any other in the greater Universe.  

pg. 39

In Cosmic Symbolism, Sepharial has shown that 5 is the only number that is universally related and has no polarity, being itself hte symbol of the co-ordinating centre of our material consciousness, i.e. the sensorium.  

Our sense of harmony is bounded by a definite set of vibrations.  We instinctively sense the fitness of certain sounds to express particular emotions.  A military march, for instance, requires a flamboyant key of G major.  To convey a sense of yearning or regret we fal naturally into the minor.  We flat our music automatically to convey a sense of depression.  

pg. 40

All our senses are just a matter of vibration.  There are things we cannot see because they are so fine and ethereal that we have no nerves delicate enough to register their contact.  We live in a world of relativity, and our relations are extremely narrow and limited.  Within the range of our senses, we define our standards of perception.

pg. 42
The following numbers balance each other (because they sum to 9):
2 and 7,
3 and 6,
4 and 5.
To complete the series we note that 1 and 8 = 9, leaving 9 as the only digit standing unpaired.

Diagram is shown of how numbers break up:
234 --- 567
 9  ---  18
    27
   -----
    9


The number 1 represents the straight line, whether by level or plumb; it is the symbol of integrity, of rectitude.
The number 2 represents parallelism, comparison, correlation, and relativity.
The number 3 represents mensuration and the brining together of things in apposition upon the common basis of fact, as positive and negative are united in force, force and matter in existence, man and woman in humanity, wisdom and love in God.  

pg. 43

Life and death are both involved in the process of creation.  

Hence in the building up of thought, we are continually converting and rearranging materials and energy we have already used.  The conservation of energy, the indestructibility of matter, and the law of permutations are the controlling factors of all human thought.  Thought is only a process of mensuration, and it is grounded in form.  All thoguht, to be definite, must have form, and form involves material.  Hence, because the property of form is dimension, our thought is compassed by the geometrical laws and answers to number.  

pg. 46, 47, 48

If a lost article be thought of and immediately afterwards a number given, this number is a natural sequence of the thought-form, to which it is related by a law of mind.  Then by the use of certain pointers or keys involved in the number, the lost article may be found.  The process should be as automatic as possible.  Quite sufficient evidence of the working of a law of mind by which numbers come to have a significance other than that of mere quantity.  

They are found to have direct relation to the nature of our thought by their correspondence with natural objects in which we are interested and which, as thought-forms stored in the memory, can at any time be evoked and brought forth by their numerical correspondences.  That is how things suggest one another in the process knwon as the association of ideas.  Nature would appear to be subject to the same law of numerical sequence, and in these pages I shall be able to show how numbers, or their sound equivalents, follow one another in rotation.  

pg. 48

What we know in science as the law of periodicity is but another instance of the rhythmic sequence of vibrations, another name for teh Kabalistic doctrine of numerical sequence.  [rluu: TODO:  Start taking notes from here.]
