pg. 2
Sepharial says the brain and nervous system of man is subject to the stimulus of etheric vibration, and thus to planetary action.  Man responds to the immediate action of the planets in their various geocentric relations, their conjunctions and oppositions, and their occursions [rluu: Eclipses?] to various signs of hte zodiac.

pg. 3
The twelve signs of the zodiac are related to various territories already defined and well-known to the ancients.  Claudius Ptolemy (one of the earliest geographers of Europe) gave certain descriptive charts delineating the countries known to him and indicating the zodiac sign to which each territory responded.  

The sign-rulership of various old countries has been traditional handed down to us, and other parts of more recent developments have been empirically referred to their respective signs.  They are:

Aries: England, Denmark, Judea, Peru, Germany
Taurus: Ireland, Persia, Italy, Chili
Gemini: Wales, United States of America, Egypt
Cancer: China, Holland, Africa
Leo: France, Australia
Virgo: Turkey, Uruguay
Libra: Argentine Republic (Argentina), Japan, Austria
Scorpio: Morocco, Brazil
Sagittarius: Spain
Capricorn: India, New Zealand, Mexico
Aquarius: Russia
Pisces: Portugal

Note: There is a conflict for the rulership of the country Germany.  In 'Law of Values', Aries is given for Germany, and in 'Hebrew Astrology', Cancer is given for Germany.  

pg. 4

Sepharial gives the mundane effects of planets Mercury through Neptune, excluding the Sun and Moon.

pg. 5

Mention of 1898 Spain war with the United States of America, coinciding with Saturn in Sagittarius.  

pg. 5, 6, 7

Sepharial gives other countries coinciding with Saturn transit into their ruling signs.  

pg. 5

1898, Saturn in Sagittarius: Spain was in an unfortunate and disastrous war with the United States of America.  Saturn gave Spain a serious time, which lasted until (in August) Senor Sagasta signed the peace treaty.

pg. 6

1900, Saturn in Capricorn: Great famine and starving millions in India.  Financially, India was okay because they were guaranteed by the British Government.

1905, Saturn in Aquarius: Russo-Japanese War broke out.  Russia lost its fleet and was forced to treaty with its foes.  Insurrection, and the terrible Red Sunday disaster, and reform followed.  The value of government securities fell during this period.

1906, Saturn in Pisces: Portugal had unrest, and culminated in the assassination of the King and Crown Prince.  Revolution followed.  Portuguese stock went down during this period.  

1898 to 1890, Saturn in Aries: Lowest records in the value of the prime security, Consols.  
[rluu: Consols are a form of British government bond.]
[rluu: Saturn is not in Aries during those years.]

pg. 7

Saturn in Taurus: Disturbances in Ireland, rioting, crime, depreciation of land values.  Persia was in a state of insurrection, the Monarch being deposed and exiled.  

Conclusion: There is a consistent record of misfortune and loss, traceable to the direct influence of Saturn in different zones related to the several countries said to be ruled by them.  We can trace the same expansive effects due to the transits of Jupiter.  


Eclipses:

Occurances of eclipses have an appreciable effectupon the fortunes of various countries ruled by the signs in which they occur.  

pg. 8

The Node moves about 1 deg 36' 40" per month.

If a new Moon occurs within 18 deg 36' of the palce of the Node, there will ben aeclipse of the Sun.

If a full Moon occurs within 12 deg 24' of the Node, there will be an eclipse of the Moon.  

The magnitude of the eclipse will be in inverse ratio to the distance.  If within five degrees the eclipse will be total.

pg. 8, 9

Except where the inherent natures of conjoined planets are mutually antagonistic, as Saturn and Mars, Neptune and Uranus, or Mars and Jupiter, we may consider the conjunction as being beneficial in its tendency.

The opposition of the planets are uniformly evil on their effects upon securities, and a fall in the share values is always to be seen when the major planets oppose one another.

The quadratures are, of course, evil in their effects, as the trines and sextiles are good. But we lay chief stress upon the nature of the planet occupying a sign, for if Saturn be in a sign whatsoever, the securities related to that sign will not advance, even though Saturn may be well aspected.


General planet effects from their natures:

Saturn: Depression.
Jupiter: Expansion.
Mars: Activity and enterprise, new developments and flotations.
Venus: Equable buying and selling.
Mercury: Nervousness or confidence, according to its aspect.


Planet combination effects:

Saturn and Uranus in conjunction produce wars and feuds, depress stocks and share values, and produce national calamities.

Saturn and Jupiter together bring about useful reforms, constitutional changes, and frequently produce the creation of funds.

Saturn and Mars bring wars, strife and upheavals, and always tend to depreciate securities.

Uranus and Jupiter bring about reforms and financial revisions, reconstruction of stocks and new share issues.

Uranus and Mars bring about insurrections and revolts, and disturb the existing order of things, thus depleting securities and deflating the markets.

Neptune and Jupiter produce unsound flotations, the creation of bogus funds, fraudulent schemes, and "rigging." Neptune in any configuration is to be mistrusted, as it tends to produce "wild-cat" schemes or downright frauds.

Mars and Jupiter bring about strong enthusiasms and demonstrations. So far as the markets are concerned, their influence is reflected in a strong "bull" tendency, highly speculative buying, and a run on stocks and shares governed by the sign they occupy.

pg. 10

Sensitive Points: The degree of the zodiac occupying the midheaven or meridian and that occupying the horizon, are sensitive points. It is found that the transits of the planets over these points are productive of very marked effects which influence the financial world to the greatest possible extent.

Senitive points given by Sepharial for various cities:

City            Midheaven    Ascendant
----------      -----------  -----------
London          Gemini 9     Virgo 14
St. Petersburg  Cancer 9     Libra 6
Paris           Gemini 11    Virgo 14
Tokio           Libra 29     Capricorn 7
Berlin          Gemini 22    Virgo 24
New York        Pisces 24    Cancer 14
Calcutta        Virgo 7      Sagittarius 2
Bombay          Leo 22       Scorpio 20
Sydney          Scorpio 10   Aquarius 16
Rome            Gemini 22    Virgo 23
Peking          Libra 6      Sagittarius 16
Cape Town       Gemini 27    Virgo 25


pg. 10, 11

Sepharial gives examples of transits over sensitive points.  

pg. 11

The Egyptian campaign and the fall of Khartoum, with the death of General Gordon took place in 1884-5, when Saturn was in the midheaven of the horoscope of London, Saturn being in Gemini 9 deg in April, 1884.

The stationary positions of the major planets in these degrees are far more effective than mere transits, and great crises always attend the stay of a planet in a sensitive degree. 

pg. 12

Rules for investing:

1) Make sure that the security is well founded, and readily dealth in on the open market.  Make sure the market responds to the sign through which Saturn last made transit [check history].  

2) Affirm the following: 

   - No eclipses occur in the ruling sign of the stock during the period for which investment is proposed to be made.  

   - No transit of Saturn, Uranus or Neptune occurs in that sign during that period.

   - Jupiter will pass through the sign during the period.

3) To buy cheaply, find a market which responds to the sign through which Saturn last made transit.  

4) Buy and hold until after Jupiter has made his transit through the same sign.  Then sell.

If for example one holds Peru stocks (ruling sign Aries), one should sell them the moment Saturn enters Aries.  

Basically the process is buy after transit of Saturn and sell after the Jupiter transit.  Sepharial says that all one has to do is keep his eye on the major planets and the eclipses.  This is a technique for investors, and not speculators.

For spectulators, he mentions that day-to-day activity can be accurately foretold.  They have secondary causes and constitue the master-key to the Stock and Share market.  He says there are primary laws, when properly understood, will instruct a man what to do and when to it.  

pg. 13

Sepharial's method of averaging is: 
Take the highest and lowest prices of a stock for yeach year during a period fo 7 or more years.  Average the 7 highest prices and average the 7 lowest prices.  The results added together adn divided by 2 gives the true average, below which it is safe to buy under NORMAL conditions of the market.  

pg. 15

The rise and fall of the great civilizations of the world can be determined with the great cyclic law of periodicity.  

Sepharial says he has respect for the greatest of astrological Kabalists, Michael Nostradamus.  

pg. 16

Sepharial makes a prediction that in 1913 will bring international and political crisis in Europe.
