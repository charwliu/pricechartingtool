pg. vi

The main purpose of this book is to demonstrate beyond all doubt or cavil, that hte Moon which plays such an important part in natural phenomena, and which, on that account, is rightly accorded a premier position in all astrological considerations, is the Silver Key to successful speculation.  

Kepler said: "An unfailing experience of the course of mundane events in harmony with the changes occurring in teh heavens has instructed and compelled my unwilling belief."


pg. vii
Sepharial says that recent scientific observations have shown that there is also an Earth-tide due to the action of the luminaries.  

Sepharial says that this is the key to the problem of speculative finance.  Not only does it work for horse races, but also stock prices, and produce (commodity) markets.


pg. 11.
All snowflakes form angles of 60 degrees, the sextile aspect in astrology, the angle at which water always crystallises.  

ALl the superior metals crystallise at the angle or complemental angle of any regular polygon that may be inscribed in a circle.  

pg. 12.
By the science of numbers, one does not infer merely the use of arithmetic processes (+, -, and proportion), but also and more particularly the relationship of quantities and values to the active principles in nature which they are held to represent, and of which figures are but the symbols.  

People referred to by Sepharial [extolling the science of numbers]:
Yellow Emperor
The Creton philosopher, Pythagoras
Arabian astronomer Albumazer
Kabalists Hiram Abif and Rosenrath
Rosicrucians and the Hermetists of the Dark Ages
Paracelsus
Cagliostro
Mendelieff (famous table of numerical ratios of the elements).

The active principles in persons and things are those which are implanted by nature through the instrumentality of planetary influence.  

John Haydon in "The Holy Guide" gives the numbers ascribed to the planets:
Saturn:   8
Jupiter:  3
Mars:     9
Sun:      1, and also 4
Venus:    6
Mercury:  5
Moon:     2, and also 7

Numbers and their meaning:
1: Origin
2: Reflection
3: Creation
4: Formation
5: Germination
6: Production
7: Satisfaction
8: Destruction
9: Distribution

pg. 13

Days are lorded by planets.
First hour after sunrise is lorded by the same planet as the day lord.  

Order of rulers of planetary hours is:
Sun
Venus
Mercury
Moon
Saturn
Jupiter
Mars

pg. 14

Sound and number, following planetary influence, play an important and perhaps a paramount part in racing results.

Planetary periods within each hour of 60 minutes:
60 minutes is divided into 15 parts of 4 minutes each.  

The lord of the hour is the lord of the first 4-minute period.  

[rluu: So since planetary hours are calculated by dividing sunrise to sunset by 12 [ref. pg. 24, and other astrological works], and thus not usually exactly 60 minutes, do we take whatever the hour amount is, and divide that amount by 15? ]

Order of rulers for the 4-minute periods within an hour:
Sun
Venus
Mercury
Moon
Saturn
Jupiter
Mars

The application of these time periods (finding winners) is partially explained in "The Mysteries of Sound and Number" by S. H. Ahmad.

pg. 15
Every sound has a numerical value, and the Kabalist have always affirmed this as a fact, it will be seen that every name must therefore be a composite of sound-values, and these values when added together will give a sum which, being reduced to its lowest or unit value, must coincide with the value of a planet, which is always expressed in units.  

According to the rules, certain letters syncopate and others are doubled, while some consonants have a single or double value.  Sepharial's view is found in a subsequent chapter.  Whatever system of evaluation we employ, every name comes to have a certain value, and consequently the unit values of all names of competitors will range from 1 to 9.

Difficulty arises for foreign names, which requires correct pronunciation from soneone who knows the foreign language.  

The determining the race start time is another area of possible difficulty.  In big events, where the competitors are numerous, the difficulty of fair starting is so great that there is a difference of over 20 minutes between teh set time and the off time of a race.  The majority of events can, however be fairly well accommodated to the system on the course.  Off the course, it is another doubtful factor upon which to speculate.  

pg. 16

Another difficulty that the student of the Alphabetical System will encounter is that, by the system of planetary periods there is a repetition of influence every sixteen minutes, or rather there is a succession of three periods of four minutes each followed by one that is neutral, and then these are repeated throughout the day. Thus, beginning with Saturn and its alternate Sun, we follow with the planet Jupiter and its alternate Venus, then by Mars and its alternate Mercury, and then by the Moon alone. After the same period the same sequence recurs continually. Then, since all numbers 8, 4/1, 3, 6, 9, 5, 7/2, are contained in sixteen minutes, and all the horses must code to one of these nine units, a large race presents the large majority of the competitors included in one of the first three periods or an interval of twelve minutes. 

A further difficulty arises from the fact that any planet can win under its own number, or that of its alternate planet, or again under the number answering to the ruler of the sign in which it is found at the time. [see pg. 16 for an example].  It is obvious, therefore, that the Alphabetical System presents many difficulties and as a system of selection could hardly be relied upon, although as illustrating the existence of a law of Correspondence between sound-values, numbers and planets, it will be found to be largely supported by results.

pg. 17

If calculation is to be made from sunrise, then the latitude of the place has to be taken into account when equating local time to Greenwich time for the purpose of this calculation.

Sepharial has invented/formulated a method called the Gravity System, which uses the actual positions of the chief cosmic factors, and is a true system of selection, and not merely one of elimination.  It employs the same factors and follows the same principle as is expressed in the law governing the tides. 

In this system we get rid of several ambiguous factors, such as coding of names, the alteration of planetary opposites, the off time of a race, considerations of form, distance, ground condition, jockeyship, etc., and rely entirely on the indication from weight, and the set time of the race; and these factors are taken in regard to the relative positions of the Sun and Moon, as regards the place for which calculation is made.

pg. 18

In regard to the system expounded in “The Mysteries of Sound and Number,” it is to be observed that the planetary numbers were given out by Godfridus and Haydon together with those of the signs, which enter into another system of similar nature published by Mr. Erskine in “Law versus Chance.” These values are traditional with the Kabalists. The system of time division into four minute periods is of Oriental origin. The credit of having combined the two and of employing them in the demonstration of the relations of sound and number is due to Mr. S. H. Ahmad. It is obvious, however, that “The Mysteries” contain only a preliminary statement of the law. The book was evidently written in the belief that planetary influence and the power of numbers lay at the root of apparently chance happenings, and this is undoubtedly the fact.


One or two methods showing the relations of number and colour to the problems of speculation.

There are many systems, certain ones based on some of the following:
  - Purely mathematical
  - Astronomical
  - Kabalistic.

Some hints may be given [rluu: by Sepharial?] regarding the kabalistic sound and number systems which appear to have a basis in truth.  Sepharial says the system of sound-values has problems because no two students will agree as to computation of such values. 

pg. 19

[Sepharial's] own view of the matter is that every letter which contributes to the sound-value of a name should be taken into account at its true value, for although certain letters are not sounded and therefore are omitted from the sound-value by some exponents, they should nevertheless be included, inasmuch as they modify the sound of other letters in the name, and, therefore, contribute to the general result. Thus, in the name of Pillo, the double L should be repeated, as Pilo is not the same thing, and the LL double letter modifies the value of the stressed vowel, and has therefore a value of 6 instead of 3.

The method which I now propose to introduce as a good specimen of the kabalistic systems that are rife observes this rule, and also has a constant value for each letter, the Hebraic values being followed. The alphabet is:

1–stands for A, Y, I, Q, J. 
2–stands for B, K, R, C. 
3–stands for G, L, S OR Sh. 
4–stands for D, M, T. 
5–stands for E, N, H (not aspirate)
6–stands for W, V, U. 
7–stands for Z, O, X (initial). 
8–stands for H (aspirate),
9-stands for X (other than initial), and F.

pg. 20

The factors employed are: 
1) Name of the place where racing occurs.
2) The day planet.
3) The hour planet.
4) The names of the horses in the race.

[rluu: He has a table for the day and hour planet values used on page 20.  I'm not sure how he arrived at the values in this table.]

Examples are given on the subsequent pages 20-23.

pg. 24

The time from sunrise to sunset being divided by 12 gives the planetary hours of the day, while the period from sunset to sunrise similarly divided gives the hours for the night.  

[rluu: How is R.A. calculated?]

pg. 25

The law of compensation is always at work; a fact which Emerson was fond of driving home to all who were unduly elated or cast down.  

pg 29

Planets are said to have a correspondence with colors, sound, forms and numbers.  In the Manual of Astrology [by Sepharial], the following are the colors corresponding to various planets:

Neptune: Mauve, lavendar, heliotrope, lilac.
Saturn: Black, dark blue, indigo, brown and the darkest shades of all colors.
Uranus: Checks, mixtures of black and white, grey, stripes and hoops, eccentricities, chevrons.  
Jupiter: Violet, purple.
Mars: Red and scarlet.
Venus: Pale blue, turquoise, and the art shades of blue and green.
Mercury: Pink, dove and blue-grey.
Moon: White, silver, sea green, straw yellow.
Sun: Orange, gold.

The colors vary slightly fromt he primaries by planetary position and aspect, but the dominant color of a planet should be conspicuous in the winning colors when that planet is a dominant factor in teh horoscope of a race.  

Examples follow from pages 30 to 31.

pg. 32

In presenting the Lunar Key to the reader, I believe that I am giving him a certain means of unlocking more than one of the mysteries that surround the vexed question of successful speculation.

The moon has a great influence on natural phenomena.

The difference between the highest and lowest weights carried by the competitors may, for convenience, be termed “the scale.”  The acceptance weights being taken, the top and bottom weights represent the extremes of gravity which have to be overcome.

All that remains to be done is to find what weight the Moon’s position corresponds with at the time of a race, for inasmuch as the Moon is a proved weightlifter, we may naturally expect that gravity will be the more readily overcome in that instance, and that the performance of the animal carrying that weight will be proportionately good.

The problem may at first sight appear very difficult, but Uranus yields here secrets to the persistent and faithful suitor, and in event it was made clear to me that she is consistent with, and not contrary to nature. 

[rluu:  What is he talking about here?  Why does Sepharial mention Uranus?]

Heavy things fall, and light things rise. 

pg. 33

The lightest weight is placed at the ascendant (Eastern horizon), and the heaviest weight is placed at the descendant (Western horizon).   The mid-heaven, which is midway between the East and West horizons, will therefore, denote the middle weight. Thus the whole range of weights will extend from the West to the East horizon.  

[rluu: Basically interpolate the weights from ascendant to midheaven, and midheaven to descendant, and then ascendant to IC and also IC to descendant.]

[rluu: See diagram in the book for more clarity.]

1 st. == 14 lb. 


The Moon’s position in regard to the horizon is constantly altering by the rotation of the Earth on its axis from West to East, so that in the course of about 12 hours the Moon appears to rise, culminate, and set.  It will therefore, be necessary to find the Moon’s place at any time in reference to the horizon of any locality.  We call this point M.

The motion of the Moon varies from day to day, and from hour to hour, but the mean motion of 13 deg 11' (nearly) may be taken as the basis of calculation for the hourly increment, so that if we take 1o 6' for every two hours or 33' for an hour  or 16' for half-an-hour, and add this to the longitude at noon, as shown in the ephemeris, we shall be quite within the limits required for our purpose.

pg. 35.

[In the example chart of the race time], the Moon is 14 deg above the West horizon, so this is the point of gravity.  The Moon's direct line of lifting power is exerted from a point 14 deg below the East horizon to a point 14 deg above the West horizon.  The weight falling on or nearest to this line of gravity must be noted.  

[rluu: The Moon's direct line of lifting power is exerted along this 180 deg axis.  Thus to apply this concept to the markets, it would make sense to find the high and low prices within a given time frame (connected to cycles), and the Moon would indicate where the price would be at within this range.  Also worth testing out is using the ascendant as price 0 (or the all-time low), and the descendant as the all-time high price, and thus compute the range for those values.]

pg. 36.

The Moon's distance from the Sun is called elongation.  A point at the same distance from the horizon as the Moon is distant from the Sun, will exert an influence as great as if the Moon itself was there. As the Moon increases or diminishes its distance from the Sun this point increases or diminishes its distance from the horizon, so that, as the combined motions of Sun and Moon result in a mean increase of elongation amounting to about 12 deg per day, the gravity point in relation to the horizon will progress at an average rate of 12 deg per day through the zodiac. Call this point G.

[rluu: Try also other planets like Bayer and Jensen suggest for the elongation from the Sun, or from another planet, etc.]
[rluu: I should try to check the gravity point in relation to the Spring Equinox on the yearly [or other] time frame also.].

The nearest distance between the Sun and Moon is always to be taken, and when it exceeds 90 deg take it from 180 deg to obtain point G.

We have now two points, that of the Moon’s distance above the horizon, and that of point G.  

Thus we have point M and point G which are the points of gravity.  

The weights corresponding with these points, and the complemental weights corresponding with their opposite points, will be the winner a large percentage of the time.  


Examples are given in the following pages from 37 to 46.

pg. 44

Sometimes the closest weight is too far from the point of gravity to be admitted.  Sepharial says to allow up to a 1/9th part of the scale (range) for the weight orb allowed.  

pg. 45

Use an ephemeris to make calculations.  Raphael's is the best and contains both an ephemeris and an aspectarian.  

pg. 46

It will be seen that the method entails a probability of one of two weights being the nearest to the weight carried by the winner, and hence it is necessary to place a stake on each of them.  All that is required is to find the two horses carrying the nearest weight to those indicated.  

Now we will try to discern between the points of M and G, for the winner.

pg. 47 (This page covers polarity)

If we take a bar of iron, or any other magnetic agent, and pass a current of electricity through its length, we have a polarised body, the molecules of which have undergone a change. We may disturb this molecular arrangement by heating the iron, and so destroy its magnetic property. But while it is polarised from end to end it is also effected by transverse magnetism at right angles to the line of its polarity. Thus a magnetic needle will always turn at right angles to a superposed current of electricity.

Now in every locality there are two planes or circles, which are found to be capable of excitation by planetary action. These are the meridian circle and the horizontal circle, and they are at right angles to one another. If a planet is found on the mid-heaven, and therefore in coincidence with the meridian circle, it is found that it not only affects that circle but simultaneously the circle of the horizon also.

Hence when the Moon is on the mid-heaven, it sometimes brings in T or B [the max and min weights at 90 deg angles from the Moon], and the middle weight indicated by the mid-heaven does not show up. Similarly, when the Moon is on the horizon it may on occasion bring in the middle weight, although its direct indication would be top or bottom weight.

The matter would seem to depend on the coincidence of certain other factors, such as a planet rising or setting at the time, or in square aspect to the ascendant.  I may say this much, however, without in any way perplexing the reader, when the Moon is at or near quadrature, i.e., 90 deg from the Sun, and at the same time just about rising or setting, the middle weight will win.

Of course, every body in the solar system exerts some attraction on the Earth, and a full computation of all these forces, taking the masses and distances of the several bodies into consideration, would give us a greater frequency of successful results; but the equation is quite beyond the powers of the average reader, and it will, therefore, doubtless content him to know that the Moon is, in proportion to its mass, so powerful in its action on the Earth as to outweigh the attraction of any other body in the system, so far as sensible effects enable us to discern.

pg. 48

M or G will yield the correct result over 75% of the time.  

pg. 49, 50

How to tell which one of M or G will give the result:

1) Determine the angle aspect between both M and G to the east or west horizon (ascendant or descendant).

2) Determine which one of M or G is in closer to exact aspect to one of the following aspects:
90, 72, 60, 45, 30, and 0

The closest of M or G to true aspect is the indicator.  

Use an aspect orb of 3 degrees.  An angle greater than 3 degrees from true aspect is not effective.  

If both M and G are inoperative due to being out of aspect, then M is generally to be preferred.

In the case of ties where M and G are equal distances from a complete aspect, M is to be preferred.

3) The indicator that is closest to an aspect is taken as the indicator, and the weight corresponding to its position is must be regarded as having a major operative influence.  

pg. 50

Alternate method proposed by Sepharial for further research.  He says that this generally works when the other main method [aspects to horizon] fails.  

Example: 
Distance from ascendant to Moon is: 71 deg
Distance from ascendant to MC is: 121 deg

Find proportion for 90 deg instead of 121 deg.

Thus: 
( 71 deg / 121 deg ) == ( X deg / 90 deg )

X = 53 deg, and the complement is 37 deg (90 - 53 = 37).  

The complement arc will usually work when teh other method fails.  

pg. 52

The public will generally be correct when:
  - Moon separating from exact aspect to:
      Neptune
      Uranus
      Saturn
      Mars
  - Moon approaching an exact aspect to:
      Jupiter
      Venus
      Sun
      Mercury
  - When moon is approaching a good aspect.
    (i.e., 60 deg, 120 deg, or conjunction to Jupiter or Venus).

pg. 53

The Moon and Sun alone do not produce tides on the earth, but that there are etheric tides caused by the relative position of the planets in regard to any locality.

The planets are the CAUSE of atmospheric disturbances and also influence human life.

pg. 54, 55

Sepharial shows his 'calculator', which are rotating wheels to help find the aspects between Sun, Moon, horizon and MC.

pg. 56

Mentioned by Sepharial: 
Law of averages
Law of permutations

Virtue and power of Numbers, of Sound and Color, and planetary influence.  

pg. 57

Sepharial warns against getting scammed by the press and professional tipsters.

pg. 58

Speculation is very old.  It shows up in ancient literature and scriptures.

The whole of life is a speculation to the man who does not know.

pg. 59

We only speak of 'luck' and 'chance' when we would avoid a confessing of our own ignorance of the law underlying the correlated successiveness of events.  

pg. 60

Mentioned by Sepharial: 
Law of the tides.
Law of optics.
Laws of the air.
Finer forces of Nature, such as electricity, radioacitivty, etc.

pg. 61 to 71 are ephemeris tables for the ascendant.

pg. 72

Last page of book.  Conclusion on this page.
