pg. 2

The "Tree of Life" of the Qabalists has been called the "Minutum Mundum" or "Little Universe."

pg. 2-3

Many works on the Kabalah vary on their proportions of the Tree of Life.  

pg. 3-4

[Method is shown for drawing a correctly proportioned Tree of Life.]
[See figure II on page 4.]

pg. 4

Vesica Pisces is formed from the intersection of two circles.

The Masonic Square has a 3-4-5 triangle.

pg. 4-5

The Geometrical way of creating a right angle as given in Euclid I, 11, was by means of an equilateral triangle, by joining the vertex with the center of the base.  He writes, "This Equilateral Triangle was the earliest symbol, in connection with the Vesica Piscis, we know of hte Divine Logos, and as the Bible declared that the Universe was created by the Logos (the Word) so the form of the Lodge which represents the Universe was naturally created by means of the Equilateral Triangle.  

[See figure III on page 5].

pg. 8

The ancient Qabalistic Tree of Life, is in its entirety based upon the same fundamental principle of hte Vesica Piscis, and is therefore nto a fixed design, but capable of indefinite progression towards the Infinitely Small or the Infinitely Great.  

pg. 10

In the Qabalah (from the three-lettered root QBL, meaning "to receive"), we find mention of the Sacred Three Lettered Name of God IHV, implying Father, Mother, and Son.  We find three Mother Letters in the Hebrew Alphabet, Aleph, Mem, and Shin, and these are attributed to the three elements, Air, Water, and Fire, which correspond to the Alchemical Principles, and in admixture form Earth, or The Stone.  

We also find in the Sepher Yetzirah, the oldest Qabalistic treatise, thatthe "One created the Univrse by means of the Three Sepharim, Number, Writing, and Speech."  These correspond to the Three Mother Letters and to the Three Paths of the Middle Pillar of the Tree, as I have shown in "Q.B.L".



The Hebrew IHV becomes IHVH through the addition of the final He, or the Daughter.  The Archetypal, Creative, and Formative Worlds become Manifest in Assiah, the Material World of the Qabalah.  

pg. 11

Tetractys of Pythagoras.  (10 unit forms or yods).

pg. 13

[Beginning of the "Sepher Yetzirah" (Book of formation) is given.]

"IAH", Lord of Hosts, engraved his name in 32 occult paths of wisdom.  
He created this universe by 3 Sepharim, Number, Writing, and Speech.  


10 numbers

22 letters: 
  3 mothers
  7 doubles
  12 simple

10 Sephiroth in the Tree of Life.

pg. 14

32 Paths of Wisdom.
10 Numerical Emanations, and their connecxting links formed by the 22 letters.
(10 + 22 = 32)

pg. 15

From "The Canon," published by Elkin Mathews in 1897, about the Vesica Piscis and its relation to the Mysteries of the Qabalah, Architecture, etc.:

"It is known, both to freemasons and architects, that the mystical figure called the Vesica Piscis, so popular in the Middle Ages, and generally placed as the first proposition of Euclid, was a symbol applied by the masons in planning their temples.  Albert Durer, Serlio, and other architectural writers depict the Vesica in their works, but presumably because of an unspeakable mystery attached to it, these authors make no reference to it."

pg. 16


Mr. Clarkson (Introductory Essay to Billings' Temple Church) considered that the elementary letters of the primitive language were derived from teh same mystical symbol.  

He says that it was known to Plato and 'his masters in the Egyptian colleges' and was to the old builders, 'an archetype of ideal beauty.'

In the East the Vesica Piscis was used as a symbol of the womb, and was joined to the cross by the Egyptians forming the handle of the Crux Ansata.

pg. 17

From "The Canon":

"Geometrically, the diagram containing the ten steps of the Cabala is shown by Kircher and other authorities in the form ascribed by Freemasons to what they call the 'Double Cube', that is to say, an irregular hexagon, which will exactly enclose a Vesica [Piscis].  [rluu: See the diagram on pg. 16].  Consequently its length and breadth are of the proportion of 26 to 15.  It is said that the ten cabalistic steps, in their entirety, symbolize the aspect of the Deity expressed by the four mystic letters IHVH, whose numerical value is 26.  This number was said by the Jews to comprise the most sacred mysteries of the Law.  No explanation, however has ever been given showing how the number 26 afforded a key to all the science of the Israelites.  It is now suggested taht the Vesica, whose proportion is the of the ratio of 26 to 15, was the symbol of the hidden rule or canon, by which the synthesis of nature was reduced to a comprehensible figure, capable of demonstrating to initiates the truth and knowledge which constituted the sacred wisdom of antiquity."

The ratio is actually:                   1 / sqrt(3)
Nearest whole number approximation is:  15 / 26


About 26:
The numeration of IHVH, 26, as shown in "Q.B.L." and elsewhere, is the "Formula" upon which the whoel System is based.  

About 15:
15 is the numeration of IH or "Jah", the venerable Name of God, attributed in teh "Sepher Yetzirah" to the Creator who devised the 32 Paths of Wisdom.  



pg. 18


The mystic number of Yesod = 45

Sum of the numbers of the Sephiroth 1 through 9, = 45

The numeration of ADM (the Hebrew Adam) = 45
The numeration of ChVH, or Chavvah (the Hebrew Eve) = 19

pg. 21

The numeration of the word IChD (which means Unity) = 22

Of these letters, three are mothers, seven are double, and twelve are simple."  We have mentioned the three Mother Letters udner the form of the Three Sepharim.  These represent the Three Elements, which combined, form Earth.  The Seven Double letters are assigned to the Seven Planetary Intelligences, the Forces which govern Nature; and the Twelve Simple letters are attributed to the Signs of the Zodiac, or Circle of Life, which represents the great Star Universe.  Thus in the 22 letters we have the basis of all Universal Ideas.
