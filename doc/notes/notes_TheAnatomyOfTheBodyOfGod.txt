pg. 2

The "Tree of Life" of the Qabalists has been called the "Minutum Mundum" or "Little Universe."

pg. 2-3

Many works on the Kabalah vary on their proportions of the Tree of Life.  

pg. 3-4

[Method is shown for drawing a correctly proportioned Tree of Life.]
[See figure II on page 4.]

pg. 4

Vesica Pisces is formed from the intersection of two circles.

The Masonic Square has a 3-4-5 triangle.

pg. 4-5

The Geometrical way of creating a right angle as given in Euclid I, 11, was by means of an equilateral triangle, by joining the vertex with the center of the base.  He writes, "This Equilateral Triangle was the earliest symbol, in connection with the Vesica Piscis, we know of hte Divine Logos, and as the Bible declared that the Universe was created by the Logos (the Word) so the form of the Lodge which represents the Universe was naturally created by means of the Equilateral Triangle.  

[See figure III on page 5].

pg. 8

The ancient Qabalistic Tree of Life, is in its entirety based upon the same fundamental principle of hte Vesica Piscis, and is therefore nto a fixed design, but capable of indefinite progression towards the Infinitely Small or the Infinitely Great.  

pg. 10

In the Qabalah (from the three-lettered root QBL, meaning "to receive"), we find mention of the Sacred Three Lettered Name of God IHV, implying Father, Mother, and Son.  We find three Mother Letters in the Hebrew Alphabet, Aleph, Mem, and Shin, and these are attributed to the three elements, Air, Water, and Fire, which correspond to the Alchemical Principles, and in admixture form Earth, or The Stone.  

We also find in the Sepher Yetzirah, the oldest Qabalistic treatise, thatthe "One created the Univrse by means of the Three Sepharim, Number, Writing, and Speech."  These correspond to the Three Mother Letters and to the Three Paths of the Middle Pillar of the Tree, as I have shown in "Q.B.L".



The Hebrew IHV becomes IHVH through the addition of the final He, or the Daughter.  The Archetypal, Creative, and Formative Worlds become Manifest in Assiah, the Material World of the Qabalah.  

pg. 11

Tetractys of Pythagoras.  (10 unit forms or yods).
