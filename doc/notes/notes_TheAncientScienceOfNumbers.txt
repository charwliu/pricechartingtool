The double vibration letters have more intensity than the single vibration letters, and the treble vibration letters have more intensity than the double vibratin letters.  

pg. 22

First  triad:  Lines 1, 5, and 7, in each vibrational set of letters.
Second triad:  Lines 2, 4, and 8, in each vibrational set of letters.
Third  triad:  Lines 3, 6, and 9, in each vibrational set of letters.

Numbers in the same triad are harmonious with each other.

pg. 27

Name Number: The number obtained by adding the letters of one's first name and reducing it to a single digit.  This number asserts itself chiefly in the general affairs of life.  We feel its power in all our social, domestic and business relations.

Birth Number: The number obtained by adding the numbers in the day-of-month of one's birth and reducing it to a single digit.  This number acts more directly upon the body, affecting the health of the individual according ot the position that it occupies in relation to the Name Number.  



The importance of bringing the two numbers into closest possible harmony is so that we can do our best work when in good health.  Strength and vitality have an immedicate and appreciable effect upon our mental and physical energies.  To bring them into alignment is to allow us to make the most out of life.  

pg. 28

Table of numbers to parts of the body:

Numbers:        Parts of the body:
--------        ------------------
1, 10, and 100  Head
2, 20, and 200  Kidneys
3, 30, and 300  Liver
4, 40, and 400  Intestines
5, 50, and 500  Stomach
6, 60, and 600  Mental Organism
7, 70, and 700  Heart
8, 80, and 800  Generative Organs
9, 90, and 900  Nervous Organism


pg. 29

Triad of 1, 5, 7, governs the upper part of the body.
Triad of 2, 4, 8, governs the lower part of the body.
Triad of 3, 6, 9, governs the liver as well as the mental and nervous system.

If the vibrations of the Name Number are very strong, and other conditions (to be explained later) are harmonious, sickness may be avoided for a long period.  

pg. 30

The opposition between the vital numbers would tend to produce equally inharmonious conditions in the particular portion of the body governed by the Birth Number, and sickness, when it comes, would naturally go to these points of least resistance.  

pg. 31

The two vital numbers are the Name Number and the Birth Number.

One can take steps to choose the best lines of occupation, best location for business or residence, the selection of companions, freinds, or business associates, the naming of articles produced for sale, the prices demanded for them, the method of sale, business names, etc., to be most harmonious.  

pg. 34

Two months are harmonious with each other if, when their number is reduced, fall into the same triad.

The days-of-the-month that are harmonious with each other if, when their number is reduced, fall into the same triad.


In beginning new things or in undertaking important enterprises, we must be careful to bring out material interests into harmonious vibration with our fortunate dates, months and years.  

pg. 35

In effect, the days, exert a greater force than the months; the months are more important than years, while the latter (year) influence general conditions more than particular events.  

The fortunate years for an individual are those that may be divided by the Birth Number.  The unfortunate years are those that are not so divisable.  

[rluu: The book says this, but in the example, he reduces the year and compares that to the Birth Number and the triad that the Birth Number is in.]

pg. 36

The Name Number is the great positive force, or, as the most powerful spiritual energy in the shaping of material things.  

The Birth Number is the great negative force; too important a factor in life to be carelessly disregarded.  

pg. 37

There are three other controlling forces that should also be taken into consideration:

1) The Cornerstone: The first letter in a name.
2) The Keystone:    The middle letter in a name.
3) The Capstone:    The last letter in a name.

pg. 39

The ideal would be to have the Cornerstone, Keystone, and Capstone in the same triad as the Name Number.  

pg. 40

It is advisable not to have the same Name Number and Birth Number because it creates very intense vibrations and intense conditions.  

Examples:
A 5 in Name Number and a 5 in Birth Number wouldlive too much in teh imaginative world.

A 9 in Name Number and a 9 in Birth Number would be too original and too nervous, for both numbers rule through the nervous organism.  

A 10 in Name Number and a 10 in Birth Number would be idealistic, too impractical.  Such a person would suffer in business and would probably have to be cared for eventually.

pg. 42

If we cannot find a perfect name (that has a harmonious total number, and also harmonious Cornerstone, Keystone, and Capstone) to fit our Birth Number, then we may adopt a new name that is not a common name.  The name chosen should be in every respect pleasing to the person adopting it.  

pg. 43

The name by which we know ourselves holds much more weight than the name by which others know us.  Excellent results may still be obtained if we merely change our name in our own thoughts.  In order to do this, it is absolutely necessary that we should always think of ourselves by our new name, and it is important that its reality should be maintained with all the force that it is possible for the mind to exert.  As long as we require its influence, we must think of it as a REAL name, just as we now think of the name that was bestowed upon us by our parents.  

pg. 44

We must think of ourselves frequently by this new name.  Two or three times each day we must devote at least a few minutes to concentration, with the new name as the object of our thought, for it is by wrapping ourselves in this new name, as we would mentally wrap a cloak about it, that we can secure the beneficent effects of the new and more harmonious conditions that we have aspired to attain.  

pg. 45

It is also helpful if we can persuade several sympathetic friends to assist us by thinking of us and referring to us always by this name that we have adopted.  WIth such help and our own sincere meditations, this new garment in which we have clothed our being will soon become real to us.  

Without such helpful influence, the desired results may be long derrred.  

A name, to be a perfect name, must have an uneven number of letters.  A name with an even number of letters is imperfect because it does not have the forceful vibrations of the Keystone letter.

pg. 46, 47

In wearing these life colors, it is not only unecessary to wear them about the attire, or on the outside of the clothing.  The colors are most effective when worn next to the person (bandages, or about the underclothing).  

pg. 48

In selecting the place in which to wear the life color, it is best to bring it close to the spot (body part) affected by the Birth Number, or Triad, as may be possible under the circumstances.  

pg. 49

Cycles: 
In the application of the Science of Numbers, a cycle is a period of nine years.  There is a period of 9 years alloted to each letter of the first name.  During this period, the letter will have stronger influence.  When all the letters in the first name have run their cycle period, then the cycle for the first letter is repeated again, and so on.
