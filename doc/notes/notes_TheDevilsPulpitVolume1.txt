pg. 6
"Unto you is born this day in teh city of David, a Saviour, which is Christ the Lord; and this shall be a sign." Now the key of the whole mystery lies in taht single phrase, [Greek words] and "this to you shall be the sign."  That is, this Saviour, which is Christ the Lord, shall be a sign.  Our English Testaments have false punctuation, contribed as much as possible to lead the people into error.

Conclusion:
Christ himself, the Saviour, which is Christ the Lord, was the sign, and that sign was to be seen in the City of David.  

There are but twelve signs in the City of David.

Sign of November, the sign is actually Sagittarius, with his bow and arrow: uniting the two natures in his own person, that is, the two natures of man and horse.  It is when the Sun is coming down from Heaven that he appears in Sagittarius, the sign of man and horse, and was born in a stable.  

pg. 7
A sign which shall be spoken against, [Greek words] -- that is, he shall be one of the adverse signs -- one of the signs of the winter months; the sign of the month November, when many in Israel, that is, the many stars that make up this constellation, sink below the horizon, and do not rise again, nor appear int eh holy city, till after his resurrection, that is after the Sun, having passed through the humiliation of his wintery state, in November, December, January, and February, appears as the Lamb of God crossing the line of the equator in March, where having overcome the sharpness of death, he opens the kingdom of heaven to all believers.

"Saints" == Stars of Heaven == The holy ones of God == the Holy City == the City of David == the City of our God == Jerusalem

pg. 8
Bethlehem == the house of bread == the tent of the Virgin of August, in which Christ is conceived; and all the Beth-saidas, Bethanies, Bethshemeshes, and Bethels, which all have their astronomical significances.  

pg. 9
Jesus Christ == Sun

Every time Jesus passes through each of the 12 signs of the zodiac, assumes the character of that particular sign, and is assimilated and entirely identified with it.  So that while he is still one, and the self-same supreme and only God, we find him continually spoken of under the most opposite and contradictory characteristics and attirbutes.  

Lamb of God == Sun in Aries (in March)
Lion of the tribe of Judah == Sun in Leo (in July)
Sign that shall be spoken against == Sagittarius == The half-man and half-horse in the gloomy month of November.  

Sacred History == occult astronomy


pg. 10
The horse and his rider == Sagittarius
The Sun is said to break and conquer this sign of Sagittarius in the summer months when he rises victoriously and throws this constellation below the horizon, so that he seems to be drowned.

Saint Augustin (St. Augustin): An orthodox Christian father, and the highest authority to us [according to Rev. Robert Taylor].  

pg. 12, 13

Athanasius Kircherius: He assures us that "by the May-bug was significied the only begotten Son of God, by whom all things were made, and without whom was not any thing made that was made."  In the 22nd Pslam, he [Jesus Christ] says of himself: "as for me, I am a worm and not a man."  In the grave, the worm conquers everyone.  We must go to the "Lord's Supper", as it is very accurately called, the 'last supper', where we shall be "at supper, like Polonius in the tragedy", not eat, but where we shall be eaten.  The text says thrice [rluu: which text?] that he is "the worm that never dieth".  

Scorpion == Blackbeetle == Worm that never dieth == Sun in sign of Scoprio, in October, the first of the winter months.  

Sun in Scoprio is the the first of the winter months, at the beginning of the gates of hell, that is, the point at which the Sun dips below the equator.


pg. 19

Be it asked, "And if I rob them of their faith (which God forgive me for being devishly like to do), what will I give them in its stead?"  I answer, I will give them learning in its stead -- I will set before them the treasures of science and knowledge, to no worse effect than to create in them an appetite for extended information.  


pg. 22

Bethlehem == the house of corn == Virgo, distinguished by the spike of corn in her hand

Jesus == 'the Jes' or Yes == the Sun

'Herod' or 'King Herod' == Hero of the Skin == King Hercules, who was always described as wearing the skin of the Cleonean Lion, that is, the Sun.

The Sun is obliged to "kill all the children that were in Judea", that is, in Bethlehem and the coasts thereof

Judea == In Bethlehem (harvest season / Virgo) and the coasts thereof.

kill == [In Greek:] to take or put away, or pass through.

two children, of two years old == the boys == children == Sun in Gemini

pg. 23

Rama == Literal name for the Zodiac; The 'high', the 'elevated', the 'exalted'. (Hindoostanee, Coptic, Syriac, Phoenician).

The whole tale of the Birth of Christ in the days of Herod the King is found in the Bhagavat Pourana of India, in the Mythsiacs of Persia, and in the famous writings ascribed to Zoroaster, teh supposed contemporary of Moses.  [rluu: Here 'days' in 'days of Herod the King', means in the measurements/ephemeris/almanac of the Sun.]

Rachael had but two sons, which were Joseph and Benjamin, and they together are accounted as making up one of the 12 signs.  [rluu: Gemini].

Pi-Ades == 'The Lord Fire' == Sun

puer == boy (Latin) == "Fire (greek), the root of the English words 'pure' and 'purity'.  

"Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God" == The Stars that shine the brightest are nearest to teh Sun.

pg. 24
Hercules == Sun == From Ammonian primities: Light, All, Fire, thus together, "the light, the universal fire", or in reverse, "the fire, the universal source of light"

pg. 25

Genius of Increase and Abundance == Virgo

Israel == The whole solar system

pg. 26

Bethlehem Ephratah == Virgo
Good-woman of the Zodiac == Virgo

pg. 26
[rluu: Author uses the phrase "thousands of Judah"... what is Judah?  All the stars in the entire Zodiac?]

In Virgo, the stars that make up the head are particularly small, and the stars that make up the arms are particularly bright.  Thus the joke, that if you want to find a good woman, you must look for the woman without a head.  The Pagan sculptors represented their Venus with a particularly small head, while Christian painters represented their Venus, the Virgin Mary, whose house of domicile actually is in Bethlehem Ephratah [rluu: Virgo], as a maid with no head at all.  Also, the brightest stars in this constellation being those which form the arms.

"Woman of Arms" == Virgo

pg. 26

"The faithful and true witness in Heaven" == Sun.

pg. 27

The Sun was looked up to, or pointed to, by every man addressing another man, and meaning to say, that what he said was truth.  So the name fo the Sun, in every country in which the Sun hath shone, is universally found to be the same as that of their form of assent or agreement, or pledge of promise.  

Worship of the Sun under the name Jupiter Ammon, was infinitely the most prevalent over all the world.

Jupiter Ammon == Sun.

The ancient Phoencian word Am -- On, litteraly signifying the 'fire', the 'being'; the name 'Ammon', pronouced in all manner of ways, through the nose, through the throat, but always with the eyes shut, to relieve them from the dazzling of the Sun's rays, as A-men (Amen), Au-men, Ah-men, O-men (Omen).

St. John: "I am the Amen, the faithful and true witness."

pg. 27, 28

Yesus == Jesus, which is corrupted by the Latin termination "us" (which is no part of it) in its dissyllabic and earlier form, is "yes", which has become our English form of assent or pledge of fidelity and truth; as we say "Yes" with the same meaning as "Amen", that is, verily, it is so -- or I consent -- I will, that is, by God I will.  Hues -- Yes -- [Greek word] -- being the most ancient name of the god Bacchus; and absolutely retained to this day upon our Christian altarpieces and pulpit cloths in those three mystical letters, [3 Greek letters], absurdly read as Roman letters "JHS" (Jesus Hominum Salvator), whereas they really are the name at full length of the Pagan god, Bacchus, the god of Wine, in whose honour at those altars our Christian Bacchanals, not knowing what they do, continue to this day to drink the sacramental wine, which is the blood of the grape -- that is, by metonymy upon metonymy, the blood of Bacchus; that is of Jes, or Yes -- the personified genius of the Sun, whose name is written in those letters I, H, S, and surrounded with that circle of golden rays.  And this same I, E, S, is composed of the Ammonian radicals, I, the one; and E, S, the fire: i.e. the one great fire, i.e. the Sun, under which identical name he was the Supreme Deity of the ancient fire-worshippers of Persia, from whom, his rites were adopted, by those who are absurdly called the primitive Christians.  

pg. 34

In the English version: "Behold there came wise men from the east", there is a deceitful translation and they were not called "wise men", but Magi -- that is, magicians, or conjurors.  

pg. 35

The ancient occult or hiddence science is that which Apostle Paul calls the Theosophy, or Wisdom of God in a mystery; but which, in plain English, is the 'black art', or magic.  

pg. 37

The Epiphany of our Lord == A Christian festival, celebrated on the 6th of January, commonly called 12th day, being twelve days from Christmas.  This festival of the Epiphany is so much more sacred than the festival of Christmas, merely, that the four successive Sundays which follow it are entitled, 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and 4th Sundays after Epiphany.  Throughout Egypt and the East, from whence Christianity was derived, the day of the Epiphany was universally observed on the 6th of January.  

pg. 38

The word "Phanes" compounded into the word "Epiphany" -- that is, of or concerning Phanes -- is a name perfectly synonymous with teh name Christ, literally signifying all the names Jesus and Christ ever signified -- that is, the Sun.  Phaneus and Phanes, from whence Epiphany, or 'Manifestation', was a distinguishing epithet of the God Apollo -- that is, the Sun, or the light of the Sun, it being the property of the light of the Sun, to make manifest; upon which property, we find the Apostle Paul playing off his puns and riddles: "that whatever doth make manifest, is light" [5 Ephesians], and John again, that "God is light, and in him is no darkness at all" and "that was the true light that lighteth every man that cometh into the world." And for this purpose the Son of God was manifested, that he might dissolve the works of the Devil, i.e. the Sun becomes Phanes, the shiny bright one, that he may dissolve the frosts of winter.  He appears in Phanes, [Greek word], the Ram of March, to counteract the evils that followed in teh train of the diabolical genius of November. 

But the God Eros, which signifies love, and was the Greek name for Cupid, received the name of Phanes, [Greek words], "because he was first manifested".  Thus, God is love!  The fragment of the Babylonian Sanchoniathon, translated fromt he Phoenician into Greek, by Philo Biblius, preserves to us this passage, fromt eh theology of the ancient Phoenicians: When the Spirit became enamoured of his own perfects, he begat Cupid -- for Cupid was the beginning of the creation of all things.  Thus little Cupid, and little Jesus who was conceived by the Holy Ghost, and who is expressly entitled the beginning of the creation of God, are demonstrated to be one and the self-same figment of imagination; and the Christian who denies the real existence of the holy child, Cupid, while he believes in the existence of the holy child, Jesus, only shows that he uses his reason in one instance, but lays it aside in the other.  

pg. 38, 39

The Roman poets, deriving their theology from the greeks, have mistaken "Phaethon", who is the same as "Phanes", for the Son of the Sun, whereas he was unquestionably the Sun himself, as the God of light, represented as the first-born of Heaven, as in that verse of the ancient Orpheus: "First-born Phaeton, Son of the far-shining morning".  This is an attirbute distinctively retained in the Christian incantation to the Epiphany: "O God, who didst manifest thy only-begotten Son to the Gentiles," as he is expressed called by the aged Simeon: "The light to lighten the Gentiles."
