pg. 12

"Most people are afraid of asking for things, and when they finally do, they don't insist enough.  That's a mistake."

pg. 15

The hourglass in the story has the words "Time is Money" engraved on it.

pg. 16

Though you must enjoy your work, that's not enough.  You must know the secrets of wealth.  

pg. 17

Secret: If you don't think you can become rich, you rarely do.  You have to believe that you can be rich, and then crave it passionately.  


The greatest limitation of people is:
  - Their own lack of imagination.
  - Their built-in prejudices.

[rluu: Practice your creative imagination.  Put no limits on your imagination.  Turn your creative thinking and creative imagination into a strength.]

[rluu: Your belief system defines you.]

pg. 22

I.M.: 

"That's exactly how I undertook my biggest deal ever.  I signed a check for $250,000 and then had to scramble around to find the money to cover it.  But if I hadn't made out that check right then and there, I'd have missed an excellent opportunity."

"That was one of my first major business lessons.  People who waste time waiting for all the perfect conditions to fall into place never get anything done.  The ideal time for action is NOW!"

"Another lesson this little exercise can teach you is this: If you want to succeed in life, you have to make sure you have no choice in the matter.  You have to put your back to the wall.  People who vacillate and refuse to take risks because they don't have all the elements in hand never get anywhere.  The reason is simple.  When you cut off all your exists and put your back to the wall, you mobilize all your inner powers.  You want something to happen with every fiber of your being."

pg. 23

"Everything is relative under the Sun.  In no time at all, this amount [of money] will appear insignificant to you."

pg. 26

Being cautious is good, but don't let being cautious cause you to miss out on a lot of good opportunities.

pg. 38

Each time you begin to have doubts [about how to become wealthy], remember Mozart: True genius lies in simplicity.

pg. 41

Write down the amount of money you want and how mcuh time you'll allow yourself to acquire it.  

This is called a "QUANTIFIED OBJECTIVE".

All the millionaires I've met told me they became rich the moment they set themselves an amount and a deadline by which to acquire it.  If you don't know where you're heading, the chances are you'll never get anywhere.

pg. 44

Spoken words are ephemeral butthe written word is permanent.


What most peopel, or at least the unsuccessful ones, are unaware of is that life gives us exactly what we ask from it.  The first thing to do, therefore, is to ask for exactly what you want.  If your request is vague, whatever you get will be just as muddled.  If you ask for the minimum, you'll get the minimum.  Any request you make must be absolutely precise.  As far as monetary wealth is concerned, you must establish an amount and a deadline by which to make it.  


If you need convincing, just ask someone exactly how much money he wants to earn next year.  Ask him to reply right away.  If this person is really on the road to success, if he really knows where he's going, and if he doesn't mind confiding in you, he'll be able to answer immediately.  Nine out of ten people, however, will be incapable of answering this simple question off the top of their heads.  It is the most common mistake.  Life wants to know exactly what you expect from it.  If you don't ask for anything, you won't get anything.  


The amount the person writes means much more than you think it does.  In fact, that amount represents almost to a penny what you think you're worth.  [pg. 49]

Expand your self-image by considering you could earn more.  By increasing the figure [of income] you wrote down, you expanded your limits.  [pg. 52]

Each time someone does this exercise, a single figure immediately exposes his true self-image.  He is confronted by his mental limitations, which will perfectly match teh limits he encounters in life.  Life will bow before the limits he sets for himself -- whether he is aware of this or not.  People who generally fail are the least conscious of these key principles of success and wealth.  Successful individuals have become aware of this phenomenon and have done their utmost to work on their self-image.  [pg. 54]

The easiest way to work on this self-image in the beginning is to take a blank sheet of paper and write down steadily increasing amounts.  Lets' start our little exercise over again.  Write down a much bolder figure this time.  [pg. 54]

You have to start by setting yourself an objective that you consider bold, but at the same time reasonable.  [pg. 55]

What you can accomplish in an hour, merely by writing down a series of larger and larger numbers is amazing.  [pg. 55]


pg. 47

The most important work you'll ever do in your life, no matter what occupation you end up choosing: It's called WORKING ON YOURSELF.


pg. 50

Keep this well in mind: All the events in your life are a mirror image of your thoughts.  

Your mind can't grasp this principle if you continue to accept the widespread illusion that external factors determine your life.  In reality, everything in life is a matter of attitude.  Life is exactly as you picture it.  Everything that happens to you is a product of your thoughts.  So if you want to change your life, you must start by changing your thoughts.  


pg. 51

In most cases, reasoning and logic become road-blocks in the way of great achievement, because great things are created only by those who have faith in the powers of the mind.  Successful people never let circumstances bother them too much.  Great achievers in the past firmly believed that they could accomplish great things.  All those who became rich were deeply convinced that they could get rich.  And that's why they succeeded.


pg. 52


All wise thinkers have said for ages that the greatest limitations are those man imposes on himself, and thus the greatest obstacle to success is a mental obstacle.  Expand your mental limits and you will expand the limits of your life.  Explode your limitations and you will explode the limitations of your life.  The conditions in your life will change as if by magic.  I swear by experience this is true.  


pg. 55

The secret of any goal is that it must be both ambitious AND within reach.  But don't forget that most peopel are overly conservative -- they're afraid to burst through their mental limitations.  They've turned their mental limitations into a kind of habit.  They're used to going without.  They're convinced that's what life is all about.  They're scared to dream.  


You must not be afraid of expanding your mental boundaries!

pg. 55-57

---------------------
Exercise:

Sit down in the privacy of your own room and write out the course of your financial destiny.  This is how to do it:

Write: 
"In six years to the day, I will be a millionaire.  I will therefore be a millionaire on [MONTH, DAY, YEAR]." 

Make note of every impression that comes into your mind, no matter what it may be.  Remember one thing: As long as you aren't used to the idea of becoming a millionaire, as long as it isn't an integral part of your life and thus of your innermost thoughts, nothing can help you become a millionaire.  

This is the practical application of my secret to becoming an instant millionaire.  You'll probably object to the fact that it'll take you six long years to become a millionaire.  I agree, but it'll take you only a second to activate the secret key that will ensure your financial destiny and fortune.  This formula has always made some people laugh, and that's not going to change.  However, the ones who laugh aren't rich!

This formula is also effective for those who want to become something other than millionaires.  After all, not everyone cherishes that ambition.  And that's precisely the beauty of this secret.  It works equally well for any dream -- from the most modest to the most extravagant.  

It can make you an extra $5000 a year, or double your income in a year (something that's totally feasible by the way).  

Reflect on this affirmation.  Let it become your guiding principle during the next six years.  


How to apply it (and convince yourself that you can be a millionaire):

The secret to developing this personality resides in words, combined with images, which are the special way in which thoughts express themselves.  Each thought you have tends to manifest itself in your life in one way or another.  The stronger a person's character is, the more powerful his thoughts will be, and the more quickly they will tend to manifest, thus shaping the circumstances of his life.  Greek philosopher Heraclitus said: "Character equals destiny." [pg. 61]

Desire is what best sustains your thougths.  The more passionate your desire is, the more quickly the thing you want to will spring up in yoru life.  The way to become rich is to desire it fervently.  In every area of life, sincerity and fervor are necessary ingredients of success.  [pg. 61]

Ardent desire is necessary, but not enough.  What you lack is faith.  You must BELIEVE that you will become a millionaire.  The way to obtain faith is throught eh repeition of words.  Words have an extraordinary impact on our inner and outer lives.  Words are omnipotent.  [pg. 62]

Words are so powerful.  Their power is so great they don't even need to be true to have an effect on people.  [pg. 67]

Words affect our lives whether we wish them to or not.  A thought, even when false, can affect us if we believe it to be true.  When you learn to distinguish the value of a thought, that is, the value you give it, your mind can regain or maintain its calm.  [pg. 69]

The formula, or affirmation, I have given you is so powerful.  Even if in the beginning you believe it highly unlikely you will ever become a millionaire, you WILL be able to become one.  Just accept the words as the truth.  If you have faith that you will be able to accomplish something, you will. [pg. 73]

The more you internalize it, the more powerful it becomes.  It's not your reasoning or conscious mind that you must convince.  It is your imagination or unconscious mind.  It is the hidden part of your mind, and much more powerful than the conscious part.  It guides your entire life.  Your unconscious is extremely susceptible to the power of words.  [pg. 74]

Your self-image is so powerful that it unwittingly becomes your destiny.  Outer circumstances end up matching the image you have of yourself with amazing precision.  To become rich, you have to create a new self-image.  [pg. 75]


---------------------

pg. 67

I just wanted to give you a quick lesson.  Experience is a much better teacher than mere theory.  Experience is life.  

pg. 68

One of the greatest laws governing the human mind:

When imagination and logic are in conflict with each toher, the imagination invariably takes over.  

pg. 70

I.M.: In the future, each time you come face to face with a problem or obstacle, remind yourself that the problem facing you has as little to do with you as this threat [of death via words, in the story] did.  This might seem unrealistic to you, since you're the one who has to deal with the problem.  But you don't have to shoulder the anxiety it breeds, or let a problem acquire so much importance that it traumatizes you.  By the time you have reached this point -- and it's not easy, I assure you -- you will have mastered an invaluable skill and will be able to fulfill all your dreams.  

Let me warn you, however.  The journey may be long and arduous before you manage to master it.  But never give up.  I promise you, it'll be worth your while.  One day you will learn that mastering your destiny and fulfilling your dreams is the ultimate purpose of life.  The rest is unimportant.  


pg. 71

Life can be a rose garden (a pleasant place) or a hell on earth, depending on your frame of mind.  Think of the rose often.  Lose yourself in the heart of a rose (i.e. a very happy place) each time a problem crops up.  And remember, you don't have to shoulder the burden of your problems.  

Most people cannot understand what I've just said.  They believe it to be pure, unadulterated optimism.  But it's much more profound than that.  The world is but a reflection of your inner elf.  The conditions in your life are but a mirror image of your inner life.  Concentrate on the heart of the rose and there you will find truth and the intuition you will need to guide you through life. 

You will also find the dual secret of true wealth:
1) Love for whatever you do.
2) Love for others. 

pg. 75-76

From the time you were a child, each suggestion you accepted, even though it was false, in effect tricked your unconscious.  You may have accepted something that was patently untrue.  So now you're going to experience the same thing.  Your unconscious can be influenced at will; it is as easy as child's play.  And once it has been influenced in the way you want it to be, you will be able to obtain exactly what you want out of life.  Why?  Because your unconscious will be convinced that you CAN obtain all these things.  

The most important thing is to pretend, as best you can, that something is true.  Why does this work with the unconscious?  Simply because, though the unconscious may be powerful, it cannot discriminate between truth and falsehood.  

The best solution is repetition.  This technique is commonly called self-suggestion.  Each one of us is subject to it throughout our lives.  Every day we are influenced by inner and outer suggestions.  The inner monologue that all of us live with continually shapes our lives.  The power of the person's self-image, which is the reflection of the unconscious, is responsible for the circumstances.  

pg. 77

The unconscious is a slave that can dominate us because it is immensely powerful.  But it is also blind, and you ahve to learn how to play tricks on it.  The beauty of this theory is that you don't really have to believe in it to use it.  But to get results you have to put it to use (i.e. do repetitions of the words).  Everything depends on repetition.  A couple of days is long enough for you to start feeling its effects.  

pg. 79

---------------------
Formula:

I.M.: Your formula could look like this.  Write on a paper:

"By the end of this year I will possess assets worth $31,250.  I will double those assets every year for five years, so that by [ENTER DATE HERE], I will be a millionaire."

You must not confuse assets and income.  Your assets are whatever you have left over after your current bills and taxes are paid.  

Now if you want to be a millionaire in six years, which is the realistic objective I am proposing, your formula will have to be set up on this model.  

Why double your assets each year?  Because it's a simple operation that your subconscious can easily handle.  And it's easy for you to remember.  It also guarantees you constant growth.  

If this starting point seems too ambitious for you, then give yourself another year.  Becoming a millionaire in seven years is still pretty good!  Your goal for the first year will then have to be assets of $15,625.  Believe me when I tell you it's far from being beyond reach.  If you're convinced that you can have a cozy nest egg worth $15,625 by the end of the first year, you WILL have it.  

Along with your formula and the affirmation "I will be a millionaire on [MONTH and YEAR goes here, which is 6, 7, or 8 years' time]", you will also have to set yourself short-term objectives, landmarks to help motivate you during your journey on the road to riches.  And an annual goal is essential.  

The most important thing is to write your goals down on paper.  Take a pencil and fool around with figures and years.  Don't be afraid; it can't do you any harm.  The amounts will become more and more familiar to you as you play around with them.  Millions of people want to get rich, and yet not one out of a hundred takes the initiative to outline the route he intends to take to reach his goal.  Be different!  Set up your plans and charts.  Work out projections until you've found the plan that suits you.  It'll be YOUR plan.  

Use the examples I've provided for inspiration, but then let your imagination run wild.  You have to start by dreaming to get rich.  Then you have to know how to quantify your dream and translate it into specific sums of money and dates.  This, in fact, should be the first exercise you do.  Juggle numbers.  You will soon see that this little game will reveal who you really are.

The simple act of putting your goals, deadlines, and sums on paper is the first step toward transformating your ideal into its material equivalent.  [pg. 82]

The formula of doubling your fortune each year is not the only way to become a millionaire.  However, the secret it contains, that is, a quantified goal (an amount and a deadline by which to reach it), is valid for anyone wishing to succeed in any way.  [pg. 82-83]

For example, you might simply want to increase your income by $5,000 a year.  If you now earn $25,000, you could simply repeat to yourself:  "This year I will increase my income by $5,000 and I will earn $30,000."  [pg. 83]

You don't need to know how you'll manage it.  Just fully permeate your unconscious with your goal, duly written down stating such and such an amount and deadline.  Your unconscious will do the rest.  Then just stay on your toes.  Since you've become aware that things won't get better on their own, when an opportunity arises, seize it without the slightest hesitation.  Don't let yourself be paralyzed by fear, which prevents so many people from living out their dreams.  You know that by doing nothing you won't get your raise.  So you mustn't hesitate to take the steps necessary to achieve your goal.  [pg. 83-84]


Correctly programmed, your unconscious will work wonders for you.  Remind it daily, so your mission becomes its magnificent obsession.  Like a remote-control missle, it will overcome all obstacles in its way to hit its target.  Such are the magical powers of the unconscious and a quantified objective.  [pg. 84]

---------------------

pg. 83

This may appear self-evident, but thousands of people hope to improve their material situation and do absolutely nothing about it.  Is this ignorance?  Is it because they are basically satisfied with their situations even though they complain day in and day out?  [pg. 83]

pg. 84-85

When creating your objectives, keep in mind that most people are much too cautious.  They don't believe they're worth anything.  

pg. 86

Life gives us exactly what we expecxt from it.  No more, no less.  We tend to forget, however, that it is generally ready to give us much more than we realize.  

pg. 86-87

Words are extremely powerful agents.  The stronger your character becomes, the more the words you utter will become genuine decrees.  Everything you affirm, fueled by deep inner conviction and strengthened by the fires of repetition, will take shape more and more quickly.  

You have to do the exercise.  Nobody can do it for you.  You must repeat your formula aloud day and night at least fifty times.  And more if you can.  Even a hundred times a day.  At first you'll find it won't be easy.  The mind is prone to wander.  If your mind strays, bring your mind back to business and start at zero again until you manage to reach fifty, because if you can't stick to such an elementary form of discipline, you'd better give up your dream of becoming rich.  All you need to do is persist.  

pg. 87-88

You must repeat the formula aloud because it affects your mind even more strongly.  The order you are issuing to your unconscious seems as though it is coming from the ouside, and thus sounds more commanding.  Say it in a monotone, like an incantation or a mantra, as the Buddhists call it.  In time the formula will acquire its own life.  

pg. 88

The goal you laid out for yourself, which seemed audacious at first, will soon appear attainable, even easy to achieve.  

pg. 89

What your mind conjured up in the past can be reformulated.  As such, you will be able to mold your future the way you want it; you will at last become master of your own destiny.  Isn't that our secret dream, even before we admit it's possible?  

pg. 91-92

During your search for wealth, never lose sight of the fact that if you lose happiness, you lose everything.  The pursuit of money can easily turn into an obsession preventing you from enjoying life.  

Money is an excellent servant, but a tyrannical master.  

[Example is given of John D. Rockefeller.]
He lived in constant fear of losing his money.  Money had become his master; he couldn't enjoy it anymore.  In a way he was poorer than a simple office clerk who could enjoy a good meal.  

pg. 93

Formula devised by the famous physician Emile Coue, for patients in his clinic:
"Every day, in every way, I am getting better and better."

Repeat this formula aloud fifty times, morning and evening, and as many times as you can during the day.  The more often you repeat it, the greater the impact it will have on you.  


pg. 94

Take the time to clearly describe what you want.  Really think things through.  Reflect upon the things that matters in your life.  

pg. 94

About happiness:

Most people want to be happy, but they don't know what they are looking for.  So inevitably, they die without ever having found it.  Even if they did find it, how would they recognize it?  [pg. 93]

They're exactly like the people searching for wealth.  They truly want to be rich, but when you ask them abruptly how much they'd like to earn in a year, most of them are incapable of answering.  When you don't know where you're going, you generally get nowhere.  [pg. 93]

To see if you're happy, ask yourself this: 
"If I were to die tonight, could I tell myself at the instant of my death that I had accomplished everythingI had set out to do that day?"  [pg. 94]

When you have done exactly what your inner self feels you should do each day, you will feel free to leave the world each day.  To be perfectly sure that you are doing what you should be doing, you will have to do what you love doing.  People who don't do what they enjoy are not happy.  They spend their time daydreaming about what they would like to be doing.  And when people aren't happy, they aren't ready to die at a moment's notice. [pg. 94-95]

It's a philosophy of life.  Those who never do what they really enjoy doing, who have given up their dreams, so to speak, belong to the living dead.  To really understand what I mean, ask yourself that question and answer it with total sincerity.  If you lie, you'll only be lying to yourself and you become the loser in this game.  If you knew you were going to die tomorrow, wouldn't you change your plans for today?  Would you do something else with your life rather than what you've been doing up to now?  [pg. 95]

You'd probably start by making the necessary arrangements: you'd make a will, if you hadn't already, and say good-bye to your family and friends.  But let's suppose that all of these tasks took only one hour.  What would you do with the remaining 23 hours?  Ask that question of everybody you know.  Their responses will invariably fall into two categories.  Unhappy peopel who don't enjoy their lives will tell you that they'd do something totally different.  Why on earth would they continue doing something they hated if they had only 24 hours left to live?  

Those in the second category, and unfortunately they're the minority, would do exactly what they normally do every day of their lives.  Why would they change anything?  Their work is their passion.  Isn't it quite understandable they would do it until their time was up?  Bach belonged to this category.  On his deathbed he was correcting his last piece of music.  But you don't have to be a genius to want to work until the end.  

So ask yourself the question: If I were to die tomorrow, what would I do with the last hours of my life?  Would I agree to go on being a shadow of my true self, lacking in self-respect, forcing myself to do something I hate?  

pg. 98

Don't you find it presumptuous of people to believe that they always have their entire lives ahead of them?  In many cases, death strikes out of the blue.  But people create the illusion that they have lots of time ahead of them, and they constantly put off the decisions they should make.  They tell themselves: "I've got time.  I'll get down to business later."  Then old age arrives and they find they haven't done anything yet.

There is a saying: "If youth only knew; if old age only could."

The secret of happiness, therefore, is to live as if each day was your last.  And to live each day to the fullest by doing what you want to do.  

You must be courages enough to act immediately.  

pg. 98-99

Live with this thought in mind: I refuse to die without having had the courage to do what I wanted to do.  Make sure your dreams are greater than your fears.  Discover what you really enjoy.  You must know how to dare!

pg. 99-100

To find out whether your job really pleases you, ask yourself this question: If I had a million dollars in the bank, right at this moment, would I continue doing the same job?  If your answer is no, you don't like it enough.  Those who would answer yes are generally already millionaires.  Most of the millionaires I know refuse to retire.  All self-made millionaires made their fortunes precisely because they loved their work.  To become a millionaire, you must enjoy your occupation.  Those who stay in a job they hate are doubly penalized.  Not only do they despise their work, but, worse yet, it doesn't even make them wealthy.  

pg. 100

Most people spend their lives in this strange paradox.  Why?  Becuase they are unaware of the genuine laws of success, and because of fear.  They waste their lives and their chances of becoming truly rich by clinging to a type of security that is mediocre at best.  They believe wealth is reserved for others, or that they don't have the necessary talent.  And why do they let themselves be tricked into believeing this illusions?  Becuase their minds are not conditioned to see reality, to see that their beliefs are an illusion.  

Remember the saying: "Character equals destiny."  Strengthen your mind, and circumstances will yield to your desires. You will gain control over your own life.  
pg. 101

I can become the master of my life and control all the events taking place in it.  We can control our destinies if we mastered our minds.  Soon I was beginning to think like that; in other words, a revolution was taking place in my mind.  It happened only after I'd spent quite some time repeating to myself: "Every day, in every way, I am getting better and better."

---------------------
pg. 102

Another formula:
"Be still, and know that I am God."

This formula is even more powerful than the previous one.  Repeating this formula has calmed me down when I felt anxious or nervous and has brought me answers when I seriously needed them.  Tranquility is the greatest manifestation of power.  This formula will bring you that feeling of serenity so necessary for getting through life's upheavals.  When my mentor decided to reveal it ot me, he said that of all the secrets in the world, this one was the most precious.  [pg. 102]

By repeating this formula, I developed a new inner power.  This power, which never ceased growing over the years, kept reminding me of something the old millionaire had repeated to me over and over again: I COULD DO ANYTHING, nothing would be impossible for me as soon as I became the master of my destiny.  [pg. 102]

Learn to listen to that tiny inner voice sleeping in teh depths of your mind and give it more freedom to express itself.  This is your intuition, the voice of your soul.  It's the way to your secret power.  The most often you repeat the formula, "Be still, and know that I am God," the more powerful your inner voice will become and the more surely it will guide you.  [pg. 109]

Repeating this formula often will help improve your concentration.  [pg. 115]

---------------------


pg. 105-108

You have already taken the first step by writing the formula and the quantified object: an amount and a deadline.  Now for the second step:  Take a sheet of paper and write down everything you want out of life.  Your dream must be precise if you want it to take shape.  

[Author gives financial objectives, and non-financial objectives.]

[rluu: I need to be ambitious.]

Making out a list like this is exactly the way to discover your narrow vision of things.  

Everything being relative, this ambition (his life objectives which were given) is hardly exorbitant.  

Most wealthy people live in houses worth millions, employ dozens of servants, and own ranches, private planes, tropical islands, racehorses and so on.  Many of them dont' even think they're rich!  In any case, not that rich, since they always have friends or business associates with more money than they have.  

Why do they find this kind of lifestyle natural?  Well, they were either born rich, or they thought big and managed to achieve their dreams.  They never believed that they couldn't do it.  If you start out with the idea that you can't, you immediately block yourself.  

So do this exercise:
Write down what you want out of life in minute detail, without holding anything back.  It will show you the limits of your ambitions and your mentality.  What are you really dreaming of?  What would you be satisfied with?  It's important to fill in as many details as possible.  

The only thing to avoid is choosing your dream home at a specific address, because that particular house may never be available and you'd be running the risk of never seeing your dream come true despite the power of your desire and will.  But other than that, be as specific as possible.  

There's one other important thing to consider, and that is the possibility that your dream is harmful to others.  Always keep in mind that if your goals are harmful to anyone, they msut be avoided for your own good as well as for the good of others.  

This portrait will show you who you really are.  It will become the concrete shape of your desires.  Your thoughts are alive.  The more specific your portrait, the better the chances are for it to materialize.  Details are very important.  In myseterious and unexpected ways, your thoughts, nourished regularly, bring about the circumstances that allow them to become reality.

As I told you, the stronger your mind becomes, the more you'll realize it can accomplish anything.  Miracles happen.  To use your mind effectively, you've got to start believing in its power, or at least be open to the possibility that it might be as powerful as I'm telling you it is.  

pg. 111-113

Learn to live in the here and now, and not dwell on the past or the future.  It's a matter of mental concentration -- focusing, contemplating, meditation -- a great many words have been used ot describe it.  The more you concentrate on what you are doing, absorbed in the task or object or person in front of you, the more you live in the present.  This focus, this concentration, is a key to success in all facets of life.  The better your concentration, the more quickly and efficiently you're able to work.  You'll spot details that others overlook.  

By increasing your own powers of concentration, you will be able to make wise observations.  You will learn to judge accurately the people you meet.  Your powers of concentration will enable you to discover at a glance who they really are.  And you will become realistic in the truest sense of the word: You will see things as they are.  

Most people go through life constantly distratced, like sleepwalkers.  They don't really see the people they meet.  They live as if in a dream.  They are never in the present.  Their mistakes and failures haunt them.  Their minds are filled with fears of the future.  

It takes practice to concentrate, and not everyone who tries it succeeds.  But when your mind reaches a proper level of concentration, your ability to solve problems becomes formidable.  You can leap over problems most people dwell on.  Instead of wasting your nervous energy biting your nails over your worries, you apply yourself to resolving them.  Being overanxious never solved anything -- it simply provoked disease.  

As you develop your forces of concentration, the image you have of yourself will change.  

Given concentration, you will understand why you've been placed where you are in the world, in this exact spot.  This will appear clearer and clearer to you, more and more obvious.  Your mind will be penetrated by very calming, reassuring thoughts, and you'll find yourself realizing, as if waking up after a long, deep sleep, "Ah! That's who I am.  that's why I'm here at this moment.  That's why I'm with this person.  That's why I'm doing what I'm doing."  You'll experience what could be called a feeling of destiny.  You'll understand your destiny.

About the rose as a talisman:

Lady Luck exists.  Trust in her.  Caress her with your thoughts.  Ask her for what you want and she will respond.  All successful people believe in luck, in on e form or another.  

pg. 115

To increase your concentration, repeat calmly to yourself: 
"Be still, and know that I am God."

When your mind has become strong and self-assured through concentration exercises, you will come to realize that life's problems no longer have any hold over you.  You'l understand that things are only as important as the mind believes them to be.  A problem is a problem only if you make it a problem.  

The stronger your mind is, the more insignificant your problems appear.  This is the source of inner peace, so CONCENTRATE.  This is one of hte greatest keys to success.  All of life is an exercise in strengthening the mind.  

THe soul is immortal.  We pass from life to life, and the mind slowly discovers itself and develops.  This apprenticeship is generally a long one.  Perhaps not all successful people have made it a point to practice specific concentration exercises.  But over the course of many lives on earth, they ahve achieved a level of concentration that allowed them to succeed more easily than others.  When your mind reaches its highest level of concentration, you will enter that extraordinary state where dreams and reality coincide.  

pg. 116-117

About problems:

Always remember that at a certain height there are no clouds.  If there are clouds in your life, it's because your soul hasn't soared high enough.  

Many people make the mistake of fighting against their problems.  What you must do is raise yourself above those problems once and for all.  The heart of the rose (the be-still affirmation) will lead you above the clouds, where the sky is forever clear.  Don't waste your time chasing the clouds, they will unceasingly reappear.  

[rluu: Basically, he is saying to re-center or re-align yourself.  I should remember to focus attention on the end-destination (the goal).  Solutions will arise naturally.  Putting your attention on the problem will cause more problems to come.]

You must start out firmly convinced that the solution exists -- the ideal solution to your problem.  The power of your mind and the magic of your objective will invariably attract the solution to you in ways you don't even suspect exist.  Be inwardly convinced that you will succeed, and you will.  Don't leave room for doubt.  Banish it with all the strength your mind can muster.  Doubt and optimism are in constant conflict.  Struggle staunchly against doubt, for doubt, like all thoughts, tends to materialize in yoru life.  


pg. 118

You must find work that is satisfying to your heart.  Think about it.  All the elements of the occupation that will please you are already within you.  You simply don't recognize them because you aren't yet in tune with your true nature.  As you continue to concentrate, to meditate more and more, you will connect with your true essence, and every answer you need will be revealed to you.  

And best of all, you will discover what most people desperately seek all of their lives and never find: the mysterious purpose of your existence on earth.  And you will understand it not only with your head but with your heart as well.  

You have everything to gain from concentrating on the heart of the rose.  There you will find the be-all and end-all of your existence.  In time, you will realize this.  


pg. 119

Lesson:

Don't be like so many people who give up before they even try.  That's the best way of never doing anything and never succeeding at anything.  And don't fall into the same trap as those who take action but are inwardly convinced that they won't succeed.  Bring your thoughts and actions into harmony.  Be in harmony with yourself!


pg. 121-122

About asking:

There you go.  Now, wasn't that easy?  All you had to do was ask.  People seldom dare to ask.  You must dare to make a request!



When you have earned a lot of money, you will realize that what counts is your mental attitude, the power of your desire, and being able to channel that power by means of a specific monetary objective.  Don't forget that outside circumstances always end up reflecting the state of your mind and the nature of your inner-most convictions.  

Remember young man, when you need money, if you are positive you can get it easily and quickly, you will.  All you need to do is ask.  If you are convinced (i.e. no doubt) that you will get what you ask for at the very moment you ask, if you act as if it is already yours, you will get it.  

When you have doubts, apply some self-suggestion.  Turn your words into commands.  When your mind has become powerful enough, each suggestion will become a royal decree.  Your words and reality will become one.  And the time it takes for your commands to materialize will become briefer and briefer and finally instantaneous.  


And you must never forget to consider the good of others at all times, so that hte power of your words doesn't turn against you.  

pg. 123

Don't let fear be your guide.  Fear is your worst enemy, the brother of doubt, and you must conquer it.  Be fearless and bold.  


Anyone who, under the pretext of caution or rationality buries the money he has received is not worth of it, and it is highly unlikely that he will get more.  Money must flow freely to be able to multiply.  

pg. 124

There is one more thing ou need to know:
The secrets I have passed on to you are effective for reaching all of the goals you will set for yourself.  

Our greatest possession is freedom, and wealth can give you freedom.  It'll be good for you to know this freedom.  With it, you will see many an illusion vanish.  You'll also understand that true freedom is found in detachment.  Only he who leaves with empty hands will be able to tend the eternal roses.  Achieving this freeom was the goal of my entire existence.  

pg. 125

A saying: 
"Once the disciple is ready, the master appears."

The soul is eternal.  And each soul travels from one life to another surrounded by companions, each helping another to fulfill his destiny.  The encounters we have during our lifetime are never the result of coincidence.  Discover who you really are.  The truth will forever set you free.  


pg. 128

About books:

Some people believe that books are utterly worthless.  They believe that they themselves are reinventing the world.  And since they have not benefitted from the knowledge found in books, they unfortunately repeat the mistakes made by their forefathers.  In this way, they waste a lot of time and a lot of money.  

On the other hand, don't fall into the trap of trusting implicitly in what books contain, letting those who came before you do your thinking for you.  Retain only what outlasts the passage of time.
