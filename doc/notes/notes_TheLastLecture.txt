Notes on the book "The Last Lecture" By Randy Pausch
##############################################################################

pg. 10

Ask yourself: What do I, alone, truly have to offer?

The lecture was called: "Really Achieving Your Childhood Dreams"

pg. 16

Walt Disney: "If you can dream it, you can do it."

pg. 33

Here's a lesson: 
Have something to bring to the table, because that will make you more welcome.

pg. 36

The importance of Fundamentals (in any subject/area).  You've got to get the fundamentals down, because otherwise the fancy stuff is not going to work.  

pg. 37

About taking criticism and advice:

It's a good thing, because you'll know how to get better.  When you're screwing up and nobody says anything to you anymore, that means they've given up on you.  

You may not want to hear it, but your critics are often the ones telling you they still love you and care about you, and want to make you better.  



About self esteem:

There's a lot of talk these days about giving children self-esteem.  It's not something you can give; it's something they have to build.  You have to give them something they can't do, they work hard until they find they can do it, and you just keep repeating the process.  

pg. 39

A second kind of head-fake (besides the sports one):

This kind of head fake is the really important one -- the one that teaches people things they dont' realize they're learning until well into the process.  If you're a head-fake specialist, your hidden objective is to get them to learn something you want them to learn.  This kind of head-fake learning is absolutely vital.  

pg. 67

About a Dutch Uncle:

One day Andy took me for a walk.  He put his arm around my shoulders and said, "Randy, it's such a shame that people perceive you as being so arrogant, because it's going to limit what you're going to be able to accomplish in life."

Looking back, his wording was so perfect.  He was actually saying, "Randy, you're being a jerk."  But he said it in a way that made me open to his criticisms.  There is an old expression, "a Dutch uncle," which refers to a person who gives you honest feedback.  


pg. 123

Randy: Andy, I just gave my students a two-week assignment and they came back and did stuff that, had I given them an entire semester to complete it, I would have given them all A's.  What do I do?

Andy: "Okay, here's what you do.  Go back into class tomorrow, look them in the eyes and say, 'Guys, that was pretty good, but I know you can do better.'".

This advice turned out to be exactly right.  He was telling me I obviously didn't know how high the bar should be, and I'd only do them a disservice by putting it anywhere.  

pg. 139

Jackie Robinson, enduring racism, vowed not to complain, even if fans spit on him.  He knew he had to work harder.  So that's what he did.  

Complaining does not work as a strategy.  Any time we spend whining is unlikely to help us achieve our goals.  And it won't make us happier.  

pg. 142

Tips for Working Successfully in a Group (fundamentals):

1) Meet people properly.  It all starts with the introduction.  Exchange contact information.  Make sure you can pronounce everyone's names.  

2) Find things you have in common.

3) Try for optimal meeting conditions.  Make sure no one is hungry, cold, or tired.  Meet over a meal if you can; food softens a meeting.  

4) Let everyone talk.  Dont' finish someone's sentences.  And talking louder or faster doesn't make your idea any better.  

5) Check egos at the door.  When you discuss ideas, label them and write them down.  The label should be descriptive of the idea, not hte originator: "The bridge story," not "Jane's story."

6) Praise each toher.  Find something nice to say, even if it's a stretch.  The worst ideas can have silver linings if you look hard enough.  

7) Phrase alternates as questions.  Instead of "I think we should do A, not B," try "What if we did A, instead of B?"  That allows people to offer comments rather than defend one choice.  

pg. 145

Look for the best in everybody.

pg. 146

Cliches:

  - Dance with the one who brought you.  
    It goes further than prom night.  It should be a mantra in the
    business world, in academia, and at home.  It's a reminder about
    loyalty and appreciation.

  - Luck is what happens when preparation meets opportunity.  -Seneca

  - Whether you think you can or can't, you're right.  

pg. 151

Showing gratitude is one of the simplest yet most powerful things humans can do for each other.  Try your best to write HAND-WRITTEN thank you notes.  

pg. 158

Randy sends Thin Mints girl scout cookies with every research paper he asks people to review.  He'd write: "Thank you for agreeing to do this.  The enclosed Thin Mints are your reward.  But no fair eating them until you review the paper."

That put a smile on people's faces.  And I never had to call and nag them.  They had the box of Thin Mints on their desks.  They knew what they had to do.  

Sure, sometimes I had to send a reminder email.  But when I'd ping people, all I needed was one sentence: "Did you eat the Thin Mints yet?"

pg. 159

All you have is what you bring with you.
This is about being over-prepared.  (Like bringing a backup overhead projector light bulb).

pg. 162

Proper apologies have 3 parts:
1) What I did wrong.
2) I feel badly that I hurt you.
3) How do I make this better?

pg. 165

The story about the $100,000 salt and pepper shaker. 

[Story about breaking the salt and pepper shaker as a kid, coming back into the store and explaining what happened and getting a new one.  That really increased their (the parents) appreciation of Disney World.  It caused them end up spending about $100,000 dollars at Disney World on tickets, food, souvenirs, for themselves and others.]

When I tell this story to today's Disney executives, I always end it by asking them: "If I send a child into one of your stores with a broken salt and pepper shaker today, would your policies allow your workers to be kidn enough to replace it?"  

The executives squirm at the question.  They know the answer is probably not.  That's because nowhere in their accounting system are they able to measure how a 10-dollar salt and pepper shaker might yield $100,000.  And it's so easy to envision that a child today would be out of luck, sent out of a store with empty hands.  

The message is this: There is more than one way to measure profits and losses.  On every level, institutions can and should have a heart.  

pg. 168

No job is beneath you. 

pg. 170-171

Know your place in whatever culture you are in.  

[Example given is when he was a top dog in academia, and then went to Disney, his credentials meant nothing, so he had to tread carefully, and gain some street credit (i.e. respect) first.]

pg. 171

Never give up.

pg. 176

When we're connected to others, we become better people.

pg. 177

All you have to do is ask.  

[A few examples given.]

He asks often: "What's the fastest I can get these results?"

pg. 182

There is a healthy balance between optimism and realism.
