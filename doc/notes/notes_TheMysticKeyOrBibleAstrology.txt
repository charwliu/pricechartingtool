pg. 15
The ancients mapped 48 constellations, and gave each of them a theological character and meaning, changeable with the position of the Sun.  This gave rise to many personfications found in the bible and other sacred writings.  

pg. 19
The author [John H. Annis], is a clairaudient (able to hear voices from the other side of life).

pg. 22
History of man: 
The Trinil and Neanderthal creatures give birth to the Cro-Magnons who have been called the paleolithic Greeks.  The Cro-Magnon and his Atlantean and Lemurian forebears were in conscious touch with the higher worlds and brought the higher concepts of God and immortality down to those who dwelt on earth.  

pg. 24
When the Sun passes over star groups, the Sun figurativly "clothes them", as the Bible puts it.  

The religions of ancient times as well as those of more modern birth, derive their highest ideals from teh celestial phenomena.  

pg. 28
Regarding the Atlanteans: Their society was much more advanced than today.  Their age was called the age of wisdom.  When the cycle completed, the greatest civilization that ever graced the earth passed out of existence.  In one fateful day, these pristine continents went down and all their grandeur lay beneath the waves.  Only a few villages were left among what had been the tops of the mountains and they in ruins.  

pg. 29

The Great Pyramid of Egypt was built nearly 19,160 years ago.  Ezekiel makes God say, "I have a witness in the land of Egypt."  He referred to the Great Pyramid.  At that time, the physical characteristics of Egypt were different.  The greater part of Sahara was covered by the ocean's waves.  High mountains were those of the Sinai group, and these, together with the ocean, made the principle difference in the climate of modern and very ancient Egypt.  

pg. 31

The Atlantean society enjoyed uninterrupted progress for more than 300,000 years, before being destroyed suddenly.  

pg. 32
It is a characteristic of the soul to express to the outer or conscious mind in symbols and it is a characteristic of the conscious mind to turn these symbols into personification.  

pg. 33, 34

Everyone in the Atlantean soceity had the power of telepathy.  They could also project their astral bodies with such force as to enable those with whom they were conversing to see and recognize them, by sight as well as sound.  They realized that man was a universe within himself, and was the exact counterpart of the Cosmos.  They found within him a correspondence to Sun, Moon and Stars.  Thei religion was of the Stars.  

pg. 35

With them the Sun was Lord and Master of the solar system and all it contained.  He was the central object of devotion and study.  He was referred to as the Most High.  He is the highest deific expression of which the physical senses can perceive.  A veritable God, the Father in a family of planets.  When he breaks forth upon the eastern horizon, he becomes the "bright and morning star", "The Light of the World", "The Day star", of all our hopes.  

pg. 36

Their close communion with the astral world; their knowledge of the mission of hte Soul and their realization of her relation to the Divine Plan, made sex perversions impossible.  They placed love int he realm of divine privlege.  Every procreative act was the conscious expression of a desire to incarnate a soul endowed with the highest capabilities.  Their life ritual rendered their children universally precocious and endowed with the hereditary possibilities that were practically unlimited; it made them a race of mental and physical giants.  

pg. 39

The Sun is the symbol of God through all ages, all nations and all religions, up to and including the present time.  

pg. 40

In ancient Egyptian Mythology, the supreme deity was called "Ra", the Sun God.  He was said to be "the protector of men and the vanquisher of evail".  He was also called "On" and later "An" and associated with the Greek "Helios", also called "Hyperion" and was represented as "rising in the morning from the ocean on the east among the Ethiopians, driving across the heavens in his glowing car and descending at evening intot he western sea".  In later times he was identified with "Apollo".  But the oldest form of the name is "Aplu" which corresponds to the Semitic name of "Ablu" the "son" of heaven.  This was one of the titles of "Tammuz", the Syrian sun-god.  Apollo is another form of this ancient name and the Sun was worshipped by the Gauls and also by the Celts under this title.  In Roman mythology, the Sun-God was called "Sol" and this name is still in common use.  

pg. 41, 42

The idea of a Trinit does not come from India, as some would have you believe.  It is the natural outgrowht of a recognition of the three active princples in nature, typified by fire, light and heat.  Sun (Brahma), light (Vishnu) and heat (Shiva).  Or, if you are afraid of the heathen, you may say Sun the father, light the Son and heat the Holy Ghost.  In John 1-1, you read, "In the beginning was the Word and the Word was with God and the Word was God".  This makes the "Word the second person fo the Trinity, while the "Holy Ghost" is spoken as the third person of the God-head.  While these are referred to individually, you are assured that they are one.  Now we have shown before that all God ideas have their origin in the Sun; then we may expect to find this sacred Trinity within the solar spheres.  Since God is Sol and Sol is Sun, then in or of the Sun must be found the other two personalities of the Trinity.  And the "Word", in its etymological sense, means Expressed, to give out, tell and that which is "given out", or expressed by the Sun is light and heat; and hence the term "Word" is the 'genius' of the Sun.  The third person fo the Trinity also comes into view showing, unmistakably its close relation to the great solar orb. The name applied to it, "Holy Ghost", from its literal root, is almost self-explanatory.   As "Holy", in its literal significance means whole, entire, all, also solar, to, or of, the Sun an "Ghost" means spirit, or vital force, life.  Then "Holy Ghost" means that vital life principle that ever flows from Sol on high, its primary head or source. So, then, the Holy Solar Ghost, when set free from teh Sun is personified as the third person of the Trinity.  

These gods are often transferred to earth where they may be in closer touch with the needs of the children of men.  Then, new names are found for them.  Thus we find that John the scribe, explains, for first is "Spirit", second "Water", and third "Blood", and then, as if to explain, he says: "These three agree in one", showing their kinship to the Sun.


pg. 45

Regarding Noah: The word "Thebah" which you render "Ark" is from the Syriac tongue and means in its etymological root, 'cow'.  Thus the word which you translate "Ark" really means cow.  In Egyptian mythology this idea comes to the fore where we read how "Isis", (nature) collected the scattered limbs of "Osiris", (Life) Egypt's God, who was slain by Typhon and entombed them in a wooded cow.  This legend of the Ark, in its various forms, was written long ago.
