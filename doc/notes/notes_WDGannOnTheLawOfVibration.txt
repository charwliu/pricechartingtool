"There is everything in a name or in a word."

How Gann's remarkable predictions (to the exact day) were made:

"By the letters of his name and the name of his mother," he replied.  "In this manner the future of any individual can be told. The first thing I do is get the mathematical angle, the length of the angle of his or her name and then that of the mother's name. Then you get the angle of the father's name, because that name you carry through life. Following this I take the Christian or given name, which is forced on you, so to speak, and calculate whether it is harmonious or inharmonious. There are just two things to everything -- harmony or inharmony, positive or negative, light or darkness, beauty or ugliness. If the name given you is out of harmony then you have got to work through that until you come into harmony. The given name gives the vibration set up in the body.  Everything is based absolutely on geometry and mathematics. You have got to prove everything in a circle, in a square or in an angle. You have got to know how a pyramid stands to a circle, a circle to a square and how they all 'match up.'"


pg. 20 
The name will more or less play an important part in the person's various spheres, but the date of birth is what determines the other angle and also complete the circle or the square.  From all this data Mr. Gann calculates the "key number" which governs him through life. That "key number" is the whole secret of Mr. Gann's discovery, and this secret he keeps within himself. For instance, the "key number" of President Wilson's name is "28," and curiously enough he is the twenty-eighth president of the United States. Therefore, the numbers "2" and "8," or their total "10," will show events of importance in Mr. Wilson's career.

pg. 34
"The vowels always produce expansion and booms, especially 'O,' while 'H' and 'N' are strong for both expansion and contraction and are fame-producing letters which wind up with crash and defeat.

pg. 46
Professor Barrett says further at the end of his Paper: – "A musical chord thus becomes both a representative picture and an acoustic painting, while the musical scale is literally a rainbow of sound.

Information from Sepharial's book:
By the Kabala of the Secret Progression, it is possible when a series of numbers is known, to determine the next.  This is a kabalistic expression of the cyclic law in numerical sequences. 

pg. 54
Information from Sepharial's book:
Hundreds of instances might have been given to show that this law of vibratory sequence is not only directly linked up with planetary sequences -- the order of the planets being always that of their relative apparent motions -- but that the sequence is equally expressed in tone, colour, and number.


pg. 56
Gann in the Ticker Interview:
I have found that in the stock itself exists its harmonic or inharmonic relationship to the driving power or force behind it. The secret of all its activity is therefore apparent. … Everything in existence is based on exact proportion and perfect relationship. There is no chance in nature, because mathematical principles of the highest order lie at the foundation of all things.

Gann in TTTA:
"...the cycle theory, or harmonic analysis, is the only thing that we can rely upon to ascertain the future."

pg. 57
"... anything that can be proved in any way or by any science is not correct
unless it can be proved by numbers and by geometry."

pg. 59
Mr. Watson in Gann's book, TTTA:

"I believe that he possessed some mathematical method which enabled him to forecast stocks many months and years in advance. I have gone over his manipulations and the stocks he traded in, and found that they conform closely to the law of harmonic analysis. He certainly knew something about time and season because he bought at the right time and sold at the right time."
