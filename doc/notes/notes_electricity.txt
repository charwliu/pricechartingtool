Sepharial's 'The Silver Key', pg. 45

If we take a bar of iron, or any other magnetic agent, and pass a current of electricity through its length, we have a polarised body, the molecules of which have undergone a change. We may disturb this molecular arrangement by heating the iron, and so destroy its magnetic property. But while it is polarised from end to end it is also effected by transverse magnetism at right angles to the line of its polarity. Thus a magnetic needle will always turn at right angles to a superposed current of electricity.

Now in every locality there are two planes or circles, which are found to be capable of excitation by planetary action. These are the meridian circle and the horizontal circle, and they are at right angles to one another. If a planet is found on the mid-heaven, and therefore in coincidence with the meridian circle, it is found that it not only affects that circle but simultaneously the circle of the horizon also.

Hence when the Moon is on the mid-heaven, it sometimes brings in T or B [the max and min weights at 90 deg angles from the Moon], and the middle weight indicated by the mid-heaven does not show up. Similarly, when the Moon is on the horizon it may on occasion bring in the middle weight, although its direct indication would be top or bottom weight.

The matter would seem to depend on the coincidence of certain other factors, such as a planet rising or setting at the time, or in square aspect to the ascendant.  I may say this much, however, without in any way perplexing the reader, when the Moon is at or near quadrature, i.e., 90 deg from the Sun, and at the same time just about rising or setting, the middle weight will win.

Of course, every body in the solar system exerts some attraction on the Earth, and a full computation of all these forces, taking the masses and distances of the several bodies into consideration, would give us a greater frequency of successful results; but the equation is quite beyond the powers of the average reader, and it will, therefore, doubtless content him to know that the Moon is, in proportion to its mass, so powerful in its action on the Earth as to outweigh the attraction of any other body in the system, so far as sensible effects enable us to discern.

'Fortunate Hours' by A. E. Partridge

pg. 7, 8

We attempt to theorize on the mystic power by which electricity travels unerringly from teh sending station to the telegraph key, almp or level with which it is in tune.  It moves that key, lights that lamp and pulls that lever, while leaving other keys, lamps or levers not in tune, undisturbed, or still greater mystery of the wireless by which the message is flashed to the middle of the ocean without any physical connection between the sending and receiving instruments.  We cannot explain the force we use, -- we can only give it a name and call it electricity or radio activity, -- but its real nature eludes us.  We know that there must be invisible forces in nature of which we are ignorant and by means of which these and many other marvels are accomplished.  Many not each human being be similarly influenced by stellar vibrations?
