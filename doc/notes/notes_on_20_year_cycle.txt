Notes on the Youtube video made by Olga Morales:

This video is showing one way of how to study long term cycles.

Quote from Gann, which he called the Master Time Factor and Forecasting by Mathemathical Rules.  

What is seen at the top of the screenshot is "BULL AND BEAR CALENDAR YEARS".
And the following texts tells about the ending digits of a decade (1 through 9) and how there are characteristics for each year.  

2:14 in the video shows Gann's master 20 year forecasting chart.  Overlapping periods of 20 years on the Dow.  

The 20 year cycle is the jupiter-saturn cycle. 
Every 60 years they come again to the exact same point in the zodiac.  

Used to forecast social, economic, political and agricultural cycles.  


So part of the journey is to understand what aspect is in effect in each of the years in the 10 years.  

Looking at aspects between these two years:
Year 1903 chart shown at 4:50 in the video
Year 1924 chart shown at 5:03 in the video
[The aspects happened late, so it was more like 21 years.]

... [charts of more years follow in the video]


This uses planetary cycles, synodic cycles, their aspects. 

Olga mentions she uses the software called: Timing Solution

rluu: 180 degrees would be every 10 years, and so the 'year' repeat would be 18 degree increments between Jupiter and Saturn.
