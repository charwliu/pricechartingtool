This file has information about the zodiac constellation "Libra" because I didn't know that it used to be the claws of the Scorpion.

Tula:


Allen [author of book called "Star Names"] says that the sacred books of India mentions this constellation as Tula, the Tamil Tulam or Tolam, a Balance. Greek has the plural word talanton, 'pair of scales', 'balance', related to Sanskrit tula, 'balance', tulayati, 'lifts up, weighs', from the Indo-European root *tele- 'To lift, support, weigh; with derivatives referring to measured weights and thence to money and payment'. 



From the book "Time and the Calendars" by William Matthew O'Neil:

Libra, the weighing scales

When 'alpha' and 'beta Librae' ceased to be the claws of the oler Scorpion, the Mesopotamian names 'SIN.RIN'  or 'ZIB.BA.AN.NA' and 'zibanitu', the weighing scales, were given to thsi constellation.  In the Denderah ceiling and in the Boll and Gundel pictures, it is represented by a balance -- fulcrum, beam and suspended pans.  In the Boll and Gundel pictures, the scales are once shown as held by Virgo and once by another female figure.  In Greek the name was either 'Chelai', the claws, or 'Zugon', the beam or the balance.  The Latin 'Libra' means the weighing scales whereas the Sanskrit 'Tula' means the beam (of the balance).

LIBRA, Centaurus and the Southern Cross

 

The original name of this constellation in the Akkadian language was Tul-Ku, meaning a sacred mound, or an altar.  Akkadians believed that the souls of the deceased were weighed at God’s altar.  The altar became synonymous with the idea of scales, where souls were weighed.  The name for these particular scales was Zibanitu, or Zuben-itu.  Because this Altar, Tul-Ku,was associated with Zuben-itu, the Balance, the two became connected in the Indian language so that the Indian words Tula or in  Tamil (a southern Indian dialect), Tulam or Tolam, all mean “Balance” or “Scales”. In Hebrew the constellation is Moznayim or “Balance” as in Isaiah 40:12. The use of the prefix “Zuben” in some of the star names therefore comes from the ancient Akkadian language.

For this reason, the Alpha  star (the furthest one to the right on the green lines in the diagram above), or Zuben el Genubi (or Ganabi) means “the balance/purchase/price is deficient.” It is also the root from which the Hebrew word “stolen” is derived.

The Beta star (the uppermost star) is Zuben el Chamali (or Shemali),  meaning “the price which covers”, a word whose root comes into Hebrew as meaning “raiment” or “cloth.” The Hebrew name for this star was Kaphar which means “to cover” or “the atonement.”

The star Gamma (connected to the Beta star, coming down to the left) is Zuben Akrabi, meaning “the Price of the Conflict” or “the Price of the War.” This could be referring both to the battle with evil on the cross (the Southern Cross constellation is a Decan of Libra) as well as Armageddon itself.    The possible reference to Armageddon can be drawn due to the fact that Scorpius, the scorpion is the next constellation in the zodiac.  More about the scorpion later, but it is important to note that this constellation always represents ‘against Christ’ or ‘anti-Christ.’  The ancient Akkadians showed something interesting on both their seals and boundary stones.  On these was a picture of the scorpion’s claws seizing the altar of Libra.  In other words, they had combined the two pictures into one and called it the “Constellation of Claws.”

The delta star in Libra is Mulu-Izi, or “Man of Fire.” 

In Revelation 13:13, we find the Antichrist calls down fire from heaven in the sight of men.  This is similar to what Elijah did in the 8th century B.C. to conquer the priests of Baal.  When he did this, Elijah was able to turn a remnant of the people back to the living god.  Revelation tells us the Antichrist will do the same to cause most people to worship him.  His evil rule is brought to an end at the Battle of Armageddon.  This is the “price of the conflict.”

The price of the conflict, however, is also on the Cross, where the payment was made for our sins, and spiritual evil was thus conquered.   So  Libra, the sacred Altar and Balance, also shows that our lives fall short of God’s standard – the price is deficient – we are weighed in the balance and found wanting. But the Price that Covers is the atonement made by Messiah for all humanity, who paid the price by His conflict against evil and shed His blood to blot out our sins.

Associated with Libra is the constellation Centaurus, with the Southern Cross at its feet, or base. 



The two bright stars on the lower left of the photo above are Alpha Centauri and Beta Centauri. They "point" the way to the southern cross, shown as "Crux" in the photograph below. The Southern Cross is in the middle of the photograph above. 


A Centaur is either a two-natured person, or a combination of a man and horse as a unit of war

The name of this constellation in Sumerian was EN.TE.NA.BAR.HUM; Habasiranu was the Akkadian name. Taking the Akkadian name apart, we get

    ANU = “Head God”; “God of the sky and heavens”; the “One with power to Judge”

    HABA = “come” or “comes” or “came”

    SIR = “command” or “order”.

    Altogether, "Comes to command, the Head God (or Judge)."

It is interesting to note that "Jamieson, in his Celestial Atlas published in 1822, says that the Arabic and Chaldean name for Centaurus was Bezeh. (Bezeh is also a Hebrew word which means 'the despised one.')" [D.E. Spencer, The Gospel in the Stars, from Word of Grace, San Antonio, Texas, 1972]

In Isaiah 53, the coming Messiah is spoken of as the Despised One.

Centaurus and Crux received ancient names because they were visible in the Northern Hemisphere 2000 years ago, although they are not now. This is because of the way the axis of the earth itself wobbles a bit.

In 525 BCE Egypt was conquered by the Persians so there is likely to have been some Mesopotamian influence on Egyptian astrology. Arguing in favour of this, Barton gives an example of what appears to be Mesopotamian influence on the zodiac, which included two signs – the Balance and the Scorpion, as evidenced in the Dendera Zodiac (in the Greek version the Balance was known as the Scorpion’s Claws).[Source: Barton, Tamsyn, 1994.
