Notes on the book "The Masonic Letter G" by Paul Foster Case.
##############################################################################

pg. vi

Masonry cannot be fully appreciated or understood without knowledge of the Qabalistic Tree of Life.  

pg. 2

The Masonic letter "G" stands for geometry.


The heart of Freemasonry is an esoteric doctrine founded on the science of geometry, and expressed by means of geometrical figures and theorems.  

In the old Masonic constitutions, it is specifically stated that Masonry and geometry are one and the same.  

pg. 3

"God" is the English name for the Grand Architect of the Universe.  

pg. 7-8

English letters are really Roman, and Roman letters are simply modified Greek, adn both Greek and Hebrew are adaptations of a Semitic original alphabet, probably Phoenician.  

pg. 10

The Tetragramaton is rendered "Jehovah" in the English Bible.


pg. 14

The 3 pillars which support the Masonic lodge are: 
  - Strength
  - Beauty
  - Wisdom

pg. 15

Qabalistic Tree of Life has 10 circles, connected by 22 lines.  

The circles represent 10 aspects or phases of the Devine Emanation.  They are numbered from 1 to 10 and are called Sephiroth, or Numerations.  The 22 lines which link these 10 circles to one another are said to represent the letters of the Hebrew alphabet, and the forces corresponding to those letters.  

The whole Tree, with its 10 numbers and 22 letters, represents the 32 paths of wisdom.  Qabalists declare this to be the Key to All things.  

pg. 16

Qabalists say this Tree contains 3 pillars:
  - Strength
  - Mildness
  - Mercy

pg. 19

Freemasonry borrowed from Qabalah the method of using letters to represent numbers, and numbers to represent words.  Mackey says this method is employed by the inventors of the higher degrees, such as those now included in the Scottish Rite.  It is one of the most important clues to the real secrets of the first three degrees, constituting the Blue Lodge, everywhere conceded to be the foundation of the whoel Masonic structure.  

pg. 20

All the mysteries of Freemasonry are sythesized in the three primary degrees:
  - Entered Apprentice
  - Fellow Craft
  - Master Mason

The number-letter system of the Qabalah is the key that unlocks this essential mystery.  

The "higher degrees" are no more than the elaboration and exemplification of what is comunicated to the three primary degrees.

pg. 21-22

When the Hebrews and Greeks composed the Bible, neither nation knew anything of the Arabic numerals.  

Hebrew Gematria has 5 special forms:
  - "kaph"   final    (500)
  - "mem"    final    (600)
  - "nun"    final    (700)
  - "peh"    final    (800)
  - "tzaddi" final    (900)

These forms are used when any of these letters comes at the end of the Hebrew word.  Thousands were indicated by writing a letter larger than the others.  

pg. 22

The Greeks used a similar scheme, but their alphabet contains only 24 letters, so the highest number represented by a single character was 800, corresponding to Omega.  The modern Greek alphabet also has no character for the number 6, but the Greeks indicated it by an ancient character known as the "digamma", or double "gamma", which had the value of 6 becuase "gamma" itself is 3.  

pg. 24

Many names of Deity in the Old Testament, including the Ineffable Name, Jehovah, are multiples of the number 13.  In the New Testament, and in teh Christian Gnostic writings, the number 37 occurs repeatedly as a multiple of the names and epithets of Jesus Christ.  

[Reference is made to Revelation 13 on this page.  This quote is about the number of the beast.]

pg. 28

The important secrets of Holy Writ have to do with number, measure, proportion, weight, and other space relationships.  


The Bible of the Qabalists is the "Zohar".

pg. 29

Qabalistic gematria gives us clues to the inner meanings of many details of Freemasonry.  

Gematria enabled the writers of both sections of the Bible to conceal geometrical formulas and measurements by means of words and phrases, or to indicate words by what appear to be merely measurements.  Both devices were employed.  

pg. 30

For Noah's ark, the measurements are actually words being given, and it is really symbolized by the tabernacle of Moses and the temple of Solomon and their furniture and appurtenances, to the real meaning of the Holy Oblation and the temple described by the prophet Ezekiel and to many other matters.  


As an example of this consider the Holy of Holies, where the ark of the covenant was kept.  The descriptions indicate that it was a cubical room.  In the tabernacle it measured 10 cubits in length, breadth and height.  In Solomon's temple it measured 20 cubits in every direction.  

pg. 31

Thus the ancient Hebrew structure which assumes so much importance in Masonic tradition, where it is said to hav ebeen the meeting-place of the mythical Masters' Lodge composed of King Solomon, Hiram King of Tyre, and Hiram Abif, was in the form of a cube.  

For the Hebrews, the "sanctum sanctorum" was the actual dwelling place of the Divine Presence or Shekinah, which rested on the mercy seat of the ark of the covenant.  As the ark was placed in the Holy of Holies, the position of hte mercy seat coincided with the interior center of that cubical room.  

pg. 31-32

Thus the place of the Divine Presence was at the center, or in the midst.  This reminds us of a passage in the "Sepher Yetzirah", which says that the place of God is the interior center from which radiate the 6 boundless lines establishing space, and sealed with the 6 permutations of the divine name "Yeho".  

A cube is a solid, bounded by 6 equal faces, and 12 equal lines.  The lines form right angles, horizontals, and perpendiculars, and they meet at 8 external points.  Thus the numbers required to define a cube are 6, 8, and 12, whose sum is 26, the numeral value of the Ineffable Name, Jehovah.

pg. 32-33

As the shrine of Jehovah, the Holy of Holies was the essential part of the tabernacle and of Solomon's temple.  On this account, the Bible says invariably that the temple was erected to the name of Jehovah, that is, in accordance with the NUMBER of that name, which is the sum of the values of the 2 Hebrew words indicating the essential quality of the nature of Deity.  

One of these words is "achad", or "One", designating the fundamental notion of Deity emphasized throughout the Old Testament.  This Hebrew word has a value of 13.  

pg. 34

The second Hebrew word adding up to 13 is "ahebah", or "Love".  

St. John is the traditional author of the Revelation.  The Gospel of St. John bears internal evidence that it was written by a person familiar with the Hellenic Logos doctrine, developed by Philo Judaeus.  This was a doctrinf o the Pythagoreans and Platonists, and it has its roots in their mathematical philosophy. 

pg. 38

The text of both Testaments contain passages deliberately composed so as to conceal numbers by words, or suggest words by numbers.  

pg. 39-41

In early Speculative Freemasonry, the Bible is called the trestleboard.  The Trestleboard shows the plans of an architect.  Such plans are based on the principles of geometry.  

pg. 41

Geometry is understood as being a key to the correct understanding of the words of the Bible.  


Paul Foster Case says that the esoteric significance of the Hebrew letter gimel, corresponds to the English letter G.

pg. 44

Traveling East in search of light, means a search for origins and causes.  
West is the place of sunset, the close of the day, thus it represents the end of a cycle of work or manifestation.  Thus, West is the direction symbolizing the things and forms produced by the Grand Architect's work in teh universe.  

pg. 46

English letter G is actually a curve taken from a spiral.  

pg. 50

The sacred delta (the symbol of Deity), is simply the equalateral triangle, composed of 3 equal lines and 3 equal angles.  In Freemasonry, there is no symbol more important in its signification, more various in its application, than the triangle.  It is connected to the number 3, and by the Hebrew character gimel.  

pg. 51

The first proposition of Euclid concerns the construction of an equilateral triangle by means of the intersection of two circles of equal radius.  

The space enclosed by this intersection is called the vesica piscis.  This vesica piscis is the basis of some of the most important geometrical secrets of the ancient operative masons.  

pg. 52

In the construction of the Qabalistic Tree of Life, as may be seen fromt eh careful examination of its proportions, the same first proposition of Euclid is employed.  Thus the master diagram of the Qabalah, the "Key to All Things," has the same geometrical foundation as the delta, most prominent of all Masonic symbols.  

That delta is what is denoted by the mystical number 3, and by the Hebrew character gimel, corresponding to G.


pg. 53 

"Chokmah" (wisdom) has a numeration of 73.

Grand Master, Solomon, said, "Happy is the man that findeth wisdom, and the man that getteth understanding.  For the merchandise of it is better than silver, and the gain thereof than fine gold."

pg. 53-54

Among Qabalists, King Solomon is reputed to have been the greatest master of the secret wisdom, next to Moses.

In Masonry, King Solomon represents the power of conception, the power of forming abstract or universal ideas, the abilityt o grasp fundamental principles.  This power is the root of all true mastery, in whatever field, and is precisely what is meant by the Hebrew noun "chokmah."

With "chokmah", Qabalists associate astronomy.  Astronomy is the pinnacle of the Masonic pyramid of instruction.  Wisdom, in the true Masonic sense, is associated the planets, their measurement relationships, and their significance to and effects on man.  


pg. 58

No man ever becomes a Mason without having expressed his trust in God.  Trust is the SEED of wisdom, and the seed is actually one with the fruit, sinc eboth are parts of one continuous process of development.  

pg. 60

Masonic tradition claims Pythagoras as "our ancient brother."  In the Pythagorean system, 10 was venerated as the symbol of the perfection and consummation of all things.  

pg. 61

In the Qabalah, the number 10 has the same prominence as in the system of Pythagoras.  


pg. 67

The name of the Hebrew letter "yod" means "hand"; the letter is really an emblem of that divine power of creation in its own image belonging to Deity.  Thus "yod" represents what the Greeks called the phallus, the male organ of generation.  

pg. 68

The male generative principle was very universally venerated among the ancients.

pg. 71-73

All ove rteh world, the serpent and the dragon are phallic symbols representing that subconscious urge which modern psychology denominates as libido.

Yet the same serpent symbol is used also to designate wisdom, i.e. chokmah, the very aspect of the One Reality which is represented by the eastern support of the lodge and by the Master.  This same wisdom is designated by the letter "yod" and the number 10.  

Zohar specifically states that "yod" is assigned to the path named "The Intelligence of Will."  This will force of "yod" is connected with generation.  

Book: "The Book of Concealed Mystery" says that "yod" is masculine, and refers to the path of foundation.  This path is the 9th Sephirah on the Tree of Life.  Its name is "yesod" meaning foundation of basis, and to it are referred the reproductive organs fo the Grand Man.  In section 42 of this same book, the letter "yod" is called, "the symbol of the member of the covenant," and this member of the covenant is the phallus.  

pg. 75

[Reference to direct consciousness of immortality.]

The rites of Eleusis and Samothrace, like those of the temple schools of Egypt, were but the preparation for an EXPERIENCE, and he whose conscious mind retained the memory of that experience KNEW himself to be immortal.  

pg. 77

He who dies and is raised is known as a "man of Tyre", or a man of the 'rock', since 'rock' is the meaning of the place name, Tyre.

The secret force which is tempered and brought under control is a force triple in aspect.  its nature is thus beautifully symbolized by the officers fo the lodge, for this force is actually derived by us directly from the sun.  Threefold in its fundamental nature, this force is raised through seven steps or stages of what the old alchemists called sublimation.  This very word has been adopted by analytical psychology to describe processes whereby the destructive amnifestations of the libido may be lifted up and transformed into beneficent expressions.  

pg. 78

The letter for "G" in Hebrew and Greek have each the value 3.  But in English, G is the the seventh letter.  Thus it represents both the triple force and the seven stages of its sublimation.  It is the only English letter which can represent 3 and 7, it combines in itself the two significant numbers whose sum is 10, the value of Hebrew "yod".
