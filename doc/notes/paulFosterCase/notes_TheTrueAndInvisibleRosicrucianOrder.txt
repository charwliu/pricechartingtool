We must emply the keys of Qabalistic and alchemical interpretation.

Rosicrucian cipher

Qabalistic keys:
  Gematria (system of biblical interpretation used by orthodox Hebrew Rabbis) 
  [pg. 33]
     Succession of letters.
     Total value.

     Special spellings and phrasings that throw light on one another
     because they have the same numerical values.

  Names and epithets for Christ in teh New Testaments, and in such writings as those of Philo Judaeus, Plutarch, and Plato, and in the books of the Gnostics.

  Formulas concealed by words and phrases were often numbers that had to do with the measurement of space, or geometry.  Sometimes applied to astronomy, music, or art of architecture.

  Geometry was considered to be a science revealing deep mysteries of God.


[pg. 34]
[Table of Numerical Values for letters]

[pg. 38] Rosicrucian texts emphacise the numbers: 3, 5, and 8.

[pg. 42] Epithets of Jesus Christ is a multiple of 37, teh number of the name Abel.

Hebrew word AChD, "achad" (unity) is composed of letters whose values are 1, 8, and 4, adding to 13.

Hebrew word AHBH, "ahebah" (love) is composed of letters whose values are 1, 5, 2, and 5, adding to 13.

Thus there is affinity between unity and love.


pg. 39-44

Pages 39-44 discuss the number 700 in literature.  

pg. 44

407 = 11 * 37
407 is equal to the phrase "he kleronomia" (Greek, for the heritage).
Gnostic Christians applied this to Jesus Christ and to the traditional wisdom transmitted orally that the Hebrews called Qabalah.

pg. 45

273 is the number value of: ChVRM ABIV, "Khurum Abiv" (Hiram Abiff)


52 is the number value of: AIMA, "Aima" (Mother)


The Qabalistic triad of Father, Mother, Son, is associated with the 3 pillars on the Tree of Life:

The Qabalistic Father is Wisdom.  
On the Tree of Life, this Sephirah is one of the three Sephiroth composing the Pillar of Wisdom.

The Qabalistic Mother is Understanding.  
The Pillar on the Tree to which this Sephirah belongs is known as the Pillar of Severity, or Strength.  

The Qabalistic Son.
The Middle Pillar on the Tree is usually called "Mildness" by Qabalists, but sometimes it is known as the Pillar of Beauty, from the Sephirah Tiphaeth, which is its central point.  
 

pg. 47

Freemasonry:

Associates King Solomon,                 with the Pillar of Wisdom.
Associates Hiram, King of Tyre,          with the Pillar of Strength.
Associates Hiram Abiff, the Widow's Son, with the Pillar of Beauty.

  Osiris, the Father, with the vertical   (3) of a Pythagorean 3-4-5 triangle.
  Isis,   the Mother, with the horizontal (4) of a Pythagorean 3-4-5 triangle.

The angle formed by the hypotenuse and base of a 3-4-5 triangle is of 37 degrees (actually 36 degrees 52 minutes).


This number, 37, is of great importance in Christian secret doctrine.  Bond and Lea, in their "Aostolic Gnosis," give a whole series of names and epithets of Jesus Christ, all multiples of 37, ranging from 37 itself up to 3996, or 37 * 108.  They list more than 500 different examples of Greek Gematra corresponding to the number 2368, or the number of "Jesus Christ" in Greek.
