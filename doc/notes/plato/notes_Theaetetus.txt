Notes on the work 'Theaetetus' by Plato.

Reference to page numbers are from my "Plato Complete Works" book published by Hackett Publishing Company, copyright 1997. 

Theaetetus starts on verse '142'.

Notes below are not complete and are hap-hazardly written as I was reading.

rluu_20130904: Notes below were taken on this date.  This work appears to have it's main superficial subject as discussing the meaning of 'knowledge', but it seems to be covering a full sequence of ideas and events that are probably the structure of a cycle.

pg. 165, 148d-e

[rluu_20130904: This is the 6th verse of this book/work, counting from 142 as the first.]

Socrates: Then do have confidence in yourself and try to believe that Theodorus knew what he was talking about.  You must put your whole heart into what we are doing -- in particular into this matter of getting a statement of what knowledge really is.  

Theaetetus: If putting one's heart into it is all that is required, Socrates, the answer will come to light.  

[rluu_20130904: At this point, for verse 148, Socrates and Theaetetus have each 6 dialogs, spoken each.]

pg. 173-174

Socrates: Mysteries begin from the pinciple on which all that we have just been saying also depends, namely, that everything is really in motion, and there is nothing but motion.  

Motion has two forms, each an infinite multitude, but distinguished by their powers, the one being active and the other passive.  And through the intercourse and mutual friction of these two there comes to be an offspring infinite in multitude but always twin births, on the one hand what is perceived, on the other, the perception of it, the perception in every case being generated together with what is perceived and emerging along with it.  

For the perceptions we have such names as:
  - sight
  - hearing
  - smelling
  - feeling cold and feeling hot
  - pleasures and pains
  - desires and fears
  - others (a great number which have names, an infinite number which have not).

On the other side there is the race of things perceived, for each of these perceptions perceived things born of the same parentage, for all kinds of visions all kinds of colors, for all kinds of hearings all kinds of sounds; and so on, for the other perceptions the other things perceived, that come to be in kinship with them.  


pg. 179, 160e
Socrates: Then that was a grand idea of yours when you told us that knowledge is nothing more or less than perception. [rluu: This was said on pg. 168, 151e] So we find the varoius theories have converged to the same thing: that of Homer and Heraclitus and all their tribe, that all things flow like streams; of Protagoras, wisest of men, that man is the measure of all things; and of Theaetetus that, these things being so, knowledge proves to be perception.  What about it, Theaetetus?  Shall we say we have here your first-born child, the result of my midwifery?  Or what would you say?

[rluu: 160e - 151e = 9]
