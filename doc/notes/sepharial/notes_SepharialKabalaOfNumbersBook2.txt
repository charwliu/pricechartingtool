pg. 9

Triangle is the symbol of Father, Mother and Child.  
Sun as Father
Moon as Mother
Earth as Son


pg. 10
Known by the Egyptians as Osiris, Isis, and Horus.

pg. 12
One of the most intricate problems that have been handed down to us from antiquity:
7 divided by two, is split into 3 and 4.

pg. 13, 14
The number 9 is associated with Vulcan, as Humanity.  It is associated with Mars and the color red, the symbol of desire.  

pg. 14, 15
Desire is the root of all action, and is the fire that, acting on the fluidic body, is responsible for all forms of emotion.  Desire it is that binds us and desire that sets us free.

pg. 17, 18
Significance is attached to the numbers 3, 7, 12, and multiples of these, in all theologies.  

By a number of deft manipulations of figures, the Rabbinical experts were able to read an entirely new and mystical meaning into the Hebrew Scripture, and this they embodied in a work which was called "Zohar".  But whereas they made use of three distinct forms of computation, they were faithful to the text and to the traditional values of the Hebrew letters, and also to their methods, so that it is surprising they should have evolved so perfect a system.  

pg. 18

It is open to us to believe either that the authors of the Scriptures deliberately planned the glyph and communicated the key to the Kabala, or that the writing of the Scripture was effected under the operation of the Law of Mind, which finds its interpretation in the mystical science of numbers.  

Having given a permanent value to the letters of the alphabet, the consistent Kabalist proceededby three methods to give a new value to every word or group of letters, adn thus a new meaning to every sentence.  

By the 'Notaricon' method, he extracted the letters from the beginning of words, from the ends of words and by a regular sequence thus obtained certain letters which, being brought together and divided into words, gave a new sentence that was not only intelligible in itself, but highly pertinent to the meaning of the text from which it was drawn.  

By 'Gemetria', he gave a value to each letter in a word and then reduced the whole word to its unit value, dealing thus successively with the words of the text, so that finally he had a number of figures which, being converted into letters gave an oracular key to the meaning of the text.  

pg. 19

By 'Temurah', he changed the letters of the text by the application of certain set rules embodied in the Table of Tziruph, so that a new interpretation of the text was open to him  

These three methods are illustrated in Sepharial's The Manual of Occultism.  

Whoever wrote the Bacon-Shakespeare plays, was a Rosicrucian and Kabalist, and an expert in the use of Kabalistic keys.  In a studied cryptogram of this nature, there was conscious purpose and experience.  The author [of the plays] had many models upon which to frame his cryptic sentences, for the secret writing of this sort had long been in use during times of wars and insurrection, and Kabalists continually use such means of conveying their teachings to those who are keen enough to perceive that an obscure sentence contains its own elucidation.  Sometimes a signal is given, as by some typographic error, peculiar spelling, or the use of an ambiguous word.  


pg. 20

In the 'Exodus', there are 3 consecutive verses, each consisting of 72 letters, which are used for conveying the names of the 72 Principalities known to Kabalists as the Shemhamphoroe, and they are each set overthe gates of the temple, six at each gate, and three gates upon each side -- one facing north, another south, one east, and another west.  Astrologers similarly divide the celestial circle into four quadrants, of three signs each, answering to the four quaters of the heavens; and each sign is again divided into three decans of 10 degrees each, and these are split into two of 5 degrees each, so that in all there are 4 x 3 x 3 x 2, or 72 'faces', as they are called, and each carries its own description and characteristics.  

[rluu: See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shemhamphorasch ]

pg. 21

Law of correspondence.  

Numbers are the only key to understanding the universe's mysteries.  

pg. 22

Water crystallizes at an angle of 60 degrees.  We know the various angles at which the metals crystallize, but our science does not enable us to say why they preserve these angles. 
[rluu: The angles of various metals or elements may provide valuable clues.]

pg. 23

Hipparchus
Ptolemny
Kepler
Tycho
Newton
Kelvin

Number, as expressed in geometrical relations, is the most intimate expression of the Soul of things. 

pg. 27

It is an interesting fact that the superior metals crystallize at the angle or complemental angle of a regular polygon.

pg. 30

The key to the study of nature is Numbers -- ratios, quantitive relations, the geometry of things.  The ancient philosophers were more conservative in the use of numbers, which they used in a symbolical sense.  

Jacob Boehme makes use of numbers only in a mystical sense.
Eckhartshausen uses numbers in a symbolical sense.
Cagliostro, used numbers in a Kabalistic sense.  

Sepharial says it is in the Kabalistic sense that they have a practical value.

pg. 31

Previous experience along these occult lines of study has shown me that only those who are ready for the idea can apprehend and absorb it.  A good many can digest it, but very few assimilate it.  It does not enter into their constitution and become a part of themselves.  It fails to affect their beliefs and their view-point in life.  It is an adjunct, not a component of their mental being.  Knowing this, one does not overfeed them, nor put all the good things on the table at once.  

pg. 32

In what, then, consists our sense of harmony?  It is inherent in the soul of man, in his laws of thought, in the numerical constitution of his being.  According to his evolution and his position in the scale of being, he embodies and responds to a definite set of vibrations.  He apprehends number because he IS number.  The mass-chord of all personal vibrations may be taken as the man's physical constitution.  The mass-chord of all his emotional vibrations is the net result of his psychic constitution.  

pg. 33

The language we think and speak in, is the language of our individual natures, tastes, appeitites, desires, and aspirations.  

Each of us has a dominant note, color, number, or vibration, and answers to that note in others.  It has been referred to as a 'signature' by Jacob Boehme in his 'Signatura Rerum', and in this sense is a physiognomy imposed by nature.  

pg. 34

The four fixed signs of the zodiac which enter into the composition of the ancient symbols of the Assyrian Bull and the Egyptian Spinx, as well as the Hebrew Cherubim.  

Lion           : Fire  : Spiritual / Spirit : Light
Man            : Air   : Mental / Mind      : Light
Eagle (Dragon) : Water : Psychic            : Dark
Bull           : Earth : Physical           : Dark


Boehme makes them correspond with the four seasons and the four corners of the Earth, or cardinal points.  

Four corners of the Earth == cardinal points

pg. 35

Technique shown for reducing planet sign positions in a horoscope to number, according to their element, and then the reducing that to the mass-chord number.  

pg. 36

Seharial says we have to modify the values of planets according to the signs they are in, since the same colors light shining through a differently colored medium will appear differently.  For this reason certain numbers are ascribed by the Kabalists to the 12 signs and gates of heavens [see Cosmic Symbolism].

Sepharial mentions two techniques:

1) The number of the planet and sign being then multiplied togehter and reduced to its unit value, the mass-chord will be different for each combination of planetary influences, and the resultant signature will be one of hte nine digits.  

2) But a more convenient method of enumerating the planetary configurations is to multiply the planetary number by the numberof the planet whose sign it occupies and then to reduce it to a unit value.  

[rluu: Sepharial says "To those of my readers who are interested in numerical horoscopy will no doubt take the hint and follow it out to its proper conclusion."  Thus it sounds like he is making extra emphasis on the value of these techniques.]


Geometry of Nature finds expression in the individual solely because he is compounded of the cosmic elements and himself a reflex of all that he holds.  If a man looks into the mirror of nature fairly and squarely, he will inevitably see only himself.  


Every individual, hence, responds to a particular number -- the highest of which is Adam, 144 --> 9, made in the "image and likeness of God."  Now God here is the Logos of our solar system, and it is not to be argued that the key number of our system is that of any other in the greater Universe.  

pg. 39

In Cosmic Symbolism, Sepharial has shown that 5 is the only number that is universally related and has no polarity, being itself hte symbol of the co-ordinating centre of our material consciousness, i.e. the sensorium.  

Our sense of harmony is bounded by a definite set of vibrations.  We instinctively sense the fitness of certain sounds to express particular emotions.  A military march, for instance, requires a flamboyant key of G major.  To convey a sense of yearning or regret we fal naturally into the minor.  We flat our music automatically to convey a sense of depression.  

pg. 40

All our senses are just a matter of vibration.  There are things we cannot see because they are so fine and ethereal that we have no nerves delicate enough to register their contact.  We live in a world of relativity, and our relations are extremely narrow and limited.  Within the range of our senses, we define our standards of perception.

pg. 42
The following numbers balance each other (because they sum to 9):
2 and 7,
3 and 6,
4 and 5.
To complete the series we note that 1 and 8 = 9, leaving 9 as the only digit standing unpaired.

Diagram is shown of how numbers break up:
234 --- 567
 9  ---  18
    27
   -----
    9


The number 1 represents the straight line, whether by level or plumb; it is the symbol of integrity, of rectitude.
The number 2 represents parallelism, comparison, correlation, and relativity.
The number 3 represents mensuration and the brining together of things in apposition upon the common basis of fact, as positive and negative are united in force, force and matter in existence, man and woman in humanity, wisdom and love in God.  

pg. 43

Life and death are both involved in the process of creation.  

Hence in the building up of thought, we are continually converting and rearranging materials and energy we have already used.  The conservation of energy, the indestructibility of matter, and the law of permutations are the controlling factors of all human thought.  Thought is only a process of mensuration, and it is grounded in form.  All thoguht, to be definite, must have form, and form involves material.  Hence, because the property of form is dimension, our thought is compassed by the geometrical laws and answers to number.  

pg. 46, 47, 48

If a lost article be thought of and immediately afterwards a number given, this number is a natural sequence of the thought-form, to which it is related by a law of mind.  Then by the use of certain pointers or keys involved in the number, the lost article may be found.  The process should be as automatic as possible.  Quite sufficient evidence of the working of a law of mind by which numbers come to have a significance other than that of mere quantity.  

They are found to have direct relation to the nature of our thought by their correspondence with natural objects in which we are interested and which, as thought-forms stored in the memory, can at any time be evoked and brought forth by their numerical correspondences.  That is how things suggest one another in the process knwon as the association of ideas.  Nature would appear to be subject to the same law of numerical sequence, and in these pages I shall be able to show how numbers, or their sound equivalents, follow one another in rotation.  

pg. 48

Nature is subject to the law of numerical sequence.  Numbers, or their sound equivalents follow one another in rotation.  

The law of periodicity is but another instance of the rhythmic sequence of vibrations, another name for the Kabalistic doctrine of numerical sequence.  

In astronomy, we have a law of cycles by which the orderly sequence of celestial phenomena can be followed.

Metonic Cycle: 19 years, lunations will recur.

Saros: 18 years 10-11 days, enables us to trace the sequence of eclipses. 

649 years, gives us the entire range of all eclipses, and after this period, they recur in the same order and in teh same part of the zodiac.  

pg. 48, 49

Cycles or series of changes in man are proportional to his average span of years.  Whereas Nature has cycle of 870 years, man has one of 8.7 years [rluu: The dot/period in "8.7" is at the middle of the line in the text.]

pg. 49

The Egyptian Alfridary is described:

They divided the stream of life into two branches called Sun and Moon, or the Light and Dark Paths.  If a child is born during the daytime, he is under the influence of the Sun and follows the Sun Path; but if born at night he follows the Moon Path.  Daytime is understood as the period from sunrise to sunset, and night is the period from sunset to sunrise.  Then they divide the life into periods of five years each, which they set under the planets in their Chaldean order, and from the combined action of the two sets of planetary influence, the Solar and hte Lunar, they determine certain climacteric periods in the life of the child then born.  The table of the Sun and Moon Paths, showing the ages at which the planets rule according the Egyptian scheme is shown on page 50.  

Years 1, 4, 8, 11, 15, 18, 22, etc., are formative and creative, involving organic changes.  
Years 5, 7, 12, 14, 19, 21, etc., are chaotic and destructive.  
Years 8, 13, 20, etc., are increscent and beneficial.  


pg. 50, 51

Seven Ages of Man (successive periods of 4, 8, 10, 19, 15, 12, and 30 years, in the order of planet velocities):

     1 -  4 years: Childhood     : Variablility : Moon
     4 - 12 years: Schooling     : Knowledge    : Mercury
    12 - 22 years: Courtship     : Love         : Venus
    22 - 41 years: Ambition      : Virility     : Sun
    41 - 56 years: Concentration : Intensity    : Mars
    56 - 68 years: Fulfilment    : Maturity     : Jupiter
    68 - 98 years: Decline       : Senility     : Saturn


pg. 51

All the phenomena of life answers to numerical sequenece.  

pg. 52

The eidophone and phonograph produce definite records of sound, and it has been found that the same forms are constantly reproduced from the same sounds.  

pg. 53

The whole of visible Nature is an embodiment of vibrations, and the ancient belief was that the first forms were produced by the Logos or Word, by which all things were created.  "And God said: Let there be ----, and it was so."

pg. 53, 54

The semaphore and helioscope are less in vogue than the telephone and phonograph, and they are very clumsy in comparison with them.  

pg. 54

In regards to feeling, which in effect is all there is of life, or in it, the language of music and hte language of words are of equal value.  

pg. 55

The natural scale bears a definite relation to cosmical factors, between sound, color and number.

Planet:      Note:    Color:    Number:
--------     -----    ------    -------
Saturn       D        Indigo    8
Jupiter      B        Violet    3
Mars         G        Red       9
Sun          C        Orange    1 or 4
Venus        A        Blue      6
Mercury      E        Yellow    5
Moon         F        Green     7 or 2


Sepharial says the values above differ from the ones given in Kabala 1.  The values here in Kabala 2 is correct in regard to the primary relations of color and number.

pg. 58

Color, form, etc., have no qualities per se, but it is we who invest them with qualities because of the influence they exert upon our emotions.  Music is simply a series of rhythmic vibrations, but can move us emotionally.  

pg. 59

Ptolemy, in his "Tetrabliblos", says tha thte Moon governs the natural or animal soul and Mercury the human or rational soul, the "epithemia" and "phren" of the Greek classification.

pg. 60

Hermes and Aphrodite, Mercury and Venus, unite to form hermaphrodite, or natural man.  

pg. 61

By the alchemy of the mind, represented by Hermetic Art, we transmute feeling into thought and thought into feeling.  It is through the intelligence principle, therefore, that number as represented by Mercury is capable of a direct correspondence with feeling.  The number of Mercury is 5, and it is the Nature-number which stands for embodied humanity.  

Moon (negative): 2
Moon (positive): 7

Moon when conjunction with Sun ==> Negative : 2
Moon when opposition  to   Sun ==> Positive : 7

pg. 62

The number of the Moon, being 2, it denotes relativity, vacillation, change; but as 7 it denotes fullness, stability.  

The Moon's body was called "Lebenah" by the Hebrews, the soul of it was "Gebur" -- one being "the fair", and the other "the strong".  

pg. 62, 63

In the Kabalists interpretation:

Egypt is the physical body (Capricorn = Saturn), the House of Bondage and darkness.

The wilderness is the period of probation in the world. 

The Hivites, Perizzites, Gergashites, Jebuzites, and Amalekites are the various passions and evil principles that "he who would prevail" (Israel) has to overcome before he can pass through the baptism of Jordan (yar-din), or River of Spiritual Knowledge, and enter the Promised Land of his spiritual heritage.  

Therefore, in the Yetzirah, or Transformations, they trace man through the cadence of his incarnations from the Sun (the spiritual state) to Saturn (the state of spiritual darkenss), and then back again from Saturn to the Sun.  

pg. 64

Scheme of correspondences in diagram form is given on this page.  

Saturn (indigo), Mars (red), Jupiter (violet).
Venus (blue), Mercury (yellow), Moon (green).


pg. 64, 65

Sepharial gives Hindu relationships of Prajapatis/Lords and Shaktis/female counterparts:

Brahma : Jupiter
Vishnu : Mars
Shiva  : Saturn

Saraswati : Mercury
Lakshmi   : Venus
Parvati   : Moon

pg. 66

Scheme presented of colors and numbers in relation to Thought and Feeling:

Jupiter : Violet : 3 -- Hope, optimism, expansion.
Saturn  : Indigo : 8 -- Contemplation, philosophy.
Venus   : Blue   : 6 -- Purity, spirituality, peace.
Moon    : Green  : 2 -- Sensation, variability.
Mercury : Yellow : 5 -- Mind, intellection, perception.
Sun     : Orange : 4 -- Vitality, force.
Mars    : Red    : 9 -- Zeal, energy, intensity.

pg. 67

Number is more immediately connected with science.
Color is more immediately connected with art.

Therefore:
Science (Mercury) is considered as masculine and exterior.
Art (Venus) is considered as feminine and interior.

pg. 68

Bringing color and number into line with what has been observed regarding sound, the correspondence of primaries is:

Planet:      Note:    Color:    Number:
--------     -----    ------    -------
Sun          C        Orange    1 or 4
Saturn       D        Indigo    8
Mercury      E        Yellow    5
Moon         F        Green     7 or 2
Mars         G        Red       9
Venus        A        Blue      6
Jupiter      B        Violet    3


[rluu: This is the same as given on page 55.]

pg. 70

Scale of Correspondences, showing the related pairs of principles on the Divine, spiritual and human planes: 

    Life
    Wisdom -- Love
    Volition
    Truth -- Charity
    Desire
    Knowledge -- Affection
    Thought -- Feeling
    Speech -- Action
    Character

pg. 71

I [Sepharial] have already shown in Kabala I, chapter 4, that man answers to a certain numerical plan known as the "Square of Three".  He is embodied cosmos, and, being compounded of cosmic elements, he responds to the planets of the solar system, and to the numbers, colors, sounds, and forms associated with them. 

pg. 72

The sign occupied by the Moon at the birth of a person is that which, by its planetary and numerical affinity, controls or determins the particular charactertic that is dominant in that person. 

pg. 73

Aries and Scorpio, signs of Mars, answer to number 9.
Taurus and Libra, signs of Venus, answer to number 6.
Gemini and Virgo, signs of Mercury, answer to number 5.
Cancer, sign of Moon, answer to numbers 2 and 7.
Leo, sign of Sun, answer to numbers 1 and 4.
Sagittarius and Pisces, signs of Jupiter, answer to number 3.
Capricorn and Aquarius, signs of Saturn, answer to number 8.

pg. 73-76

Sepharial applies these numbers to the sign location of the Moon at birth.  In the examples, he is doing the following:

1) Sepharial looks at the sign that the Moon is in for the first number.
2) Sepharial looks at the sign that the despositor of the Moon is in for the second number.  

Both these numbers have influence according to the qualities of the number (and the corresponding planet for that number).

pg. 76, 77.

3) For the third number, Sepharial adds the Moon number to the first two numbers, and reduces.  He only does this if the Moon sign is not in its own sign.  If it is in it's own sign then only the Moon's number is taken as the number.  

pg. 77

The planets which hold the four angles of a horoscope (Midheaven, Ascendant, Descendant, and Nadir), have the most marked effect on the character and destiny of individuals.

pg. 81

Saturn 8, rules Capricorn; and the Moon 2, rules Cancer, the opposite sign.  Similarly, we have the dark blue of Saturn opposed to the yellow of the Moon.

[rluu: Here it appears Sepharial is now talking about planet colors.]

pg. 82

Table of Planetary Variants is given.  This expresses the polarities between the planets. 

pg. 83

Polarities:

Saturn  is polarized by the Moon.
Mars    is polarized by the Venus.
Jupiter is polarized by the Mercury.

This is conveyed by the astrological paradigm of the Seal of Solomon (two triangles interlaced, one of them being inverted).  One triangle represents the spiritual and the other the material.  The positive trigon (upward pointing triangle) is represented by Saturn-Jupiter-Mars, the male planets.  The negative trigon (downward pointing triangle) is represented by Venus-Mercury-Moon, the female planets.  

pg. 84

The vital principle, Sun (4), is the fulcrum of manifestation.

pg. 86

Reference to Emanuel Swedenborg's "Earths of the Universe".

pg. 87, 88

Number series from 0 to 9 is analyzed, reduced similarly to how is done by Numero (numbers reduced downward in a tree-like fashion).  Sepharial notes that in rows, there are certain patterns, and that certain numbers appear, disappear, and re-appear.  

The last two numbers before the final row are 7 and 2, two moon numbers, (positive and negative).  

pg. 88

The number series finally resolves itself to the number 9, which is the symbolical expression of the Adamic race, the 12 x 12 or 144, indicated by the values ADM = 144, according to the Hebraic Kabala.  

pg. 89

Humanity = 9.

Numerical polarizations:
9 = Sun (positive) 1 + Saturn 8
9 = Jupiter 3 + Venus 6
9 = Mercury 5 + Sun (negative) 4

Mars = 9, the tonic of our scale.  
Moon, the variable factor, 7 (positive) and 2 (negative).


pg. 90

10 is regarded as the Perfect Number.
 5 is regarded as the number of discrimation, discernment, intellection.

Characteristics of the expression of numbers:

Dignity       1  Pride
Flexibility   2  Vacillation
Generosity    3  Extravagance
Practicality  4  Ostentation
Discernment   5  Inquisitiveness
Gentleness    6  Laxity
Purpose       7  Prejudice
Discretion    8  Timidity
Zeal          9  Bigotry

pg. 91-95

Kabala of the Square of Three (3x3) (also mentioned in Kabala I, chap 4) is described.

Examples given for St. Louis, Napoleon I, Milton, Cagliostro, Louis XVI.

pg. 95-98

Sepharial suggests that to be consistent with the use of numbers:

Instead of taking the month of birth as 1 for January, 2 for February, etc., to instead take the value of the planet ruling the sign in which the Sun is at the time.  If the Sun is in Cancer, then 7 is taken for a male birth and 2 is taken for a female birth.  If the Sun is in Leo, then 1 is taken for a male birth and 4 is taken for a female birth.  

Also, to be consistent, we would take the actual day of the week, and use the value of the planet ruling that day.  


Days of the week:
The day of the week begins at noon for each day.

Day       Ruler    Number
------    -----    ------
Sunday    Sun      1 when Sun is in odd sign, 4 when Sun is in even sign.
Monday    Moon     7 when Moon is in odd sign, 2 when Moon is in even sign.
Tuesday   Mars     9
Wednesday Mercury  5
Thursday  Jupiter  3
Friday    Venus    6
Saturn    Saturn   8

pg. 98, 99

Sepharial says Sound Value evaluation is satisfactory for names.  Each system has to be employed with its own method of interpretation (you can't mix them).

Hebrew method is employed for the Kabalistic interpretation of the Scripture, as in the Zohar.

pg. 100

A scheme of letters to numbers is given.  

[rluu: My guess is that Sepharial is trying to show the Pythagorean system, but the formatting of the text shows letters not aligned with the numbers.]

Scheme of zodiac signs to letters:

Aries: AN
Taurus: BO
Gemini: CP
Cancer: DQ
Leo: ER
Virgo: FS
Libra: GT
Scorpio: HU
Sagittarius: IJVW
Capricorn: KX
Aquarius: LY
Pisces: MZ

pg. 101

In Sepharial's example, Moon is white, Mars is red.  

pg. 103

Law of periodicity.

Particular factors are bound to recur at stated and predictable intervals.  

pg. 104

Two factors given for this argument:  Sun and Moon.

New moon corresponds to Spring Tides.
Full moon corresponds to Neap Tides.

[rluu: Confirm this.]


Common formula is used (in almanacs [for tides?]):   t * (d / 2)

This has a numerical significance which is quite appreciable and has a constant value for the same day of the Moon's age for every month in the year.  

[rluu: What is meant by the "Moon's age"?]

pg. 105

The tidal energy has an equivalent in regard to animate life.  

The Sun maintains approiximately the same relations with a given meridian at the same time each day, but the Moon does not do so, and it is to her variability that the gradual recession of the tides upon a meridian is due.  

Defintion of Elongation: The longitude distance between the Moon and the Sun.

pg. 106

*** VERY IMPORTANT:
The Moon is the variable factor we must look to in connection with any periodicity.


High tide would come at this amount of time (in minutes) after noon:

  (Sun longitude) - (Moon longitude) * 4

Except that there are local disturbing causes.  With these, we are not now concerned.  

[rluu: What are these local disturbing causes?]

pg. 107

Factors:

Division of circle into 12ths (30 deg angles).
Division of circle into 6ths  (60 deg angles).
Division of each quadrant into 6 hours and 7 subsections for each hour
  (4 quadrants * 6 hours * 7 subsections = 168 units).
  (42 units per quadrant).

[rluu: See the diagram of 2 interleaved triangles (one right-side-up and one inverted).]


In taking the relations of the three factors into account and applying the tidal law, we arrive at a periodicity of results that have a direct weight relation to one another.  Sepharial says he won't explain the law further; he has hinted at the method of procedure.

pg. 108

Sunrise time is: Sun's true center rising on the celestial horizon at the location.

[rluu: Sepharial says he gave the incorrect rule for sunrise time calculation in 'Kabala of Numbers, Book 2', page 85.]

pg. 110

[rluu: Sepharial calculates the hour based on the formula: (Noon - Sunrise) / 6.  Then he uses the same hour length for each hour from Noon to Sunset.  Is this correct?  Verify this.]

Each hour divided by 7 to get the subperiods within that hour.  For each hour, the subperiod starts with the same planet as the current hour lord, and proceeds in the Chaldean order (Sun, Venus, Mercury, Moon, Saturn, Jupiter, Mars).

pg. 112, 113

In analyzing the horse races, since the races were all in the afternoon, negative values for periods' lords should be used.  

[For the positive and negative numbers of the planets, see page 90 of 'Kabala of Numbers, Book 1'.]


The winning horse has matching phonetic numerical value that is equal to the period's ruling planet's negative number.  In the cases where the rule failed, the winner matched the negative number of the planet in whose sign the ruler of the period is found.  

When the events do not fall into line with this law, the races are won by the number represented by the SIGN the Moon is in.  This is invariably the case when the Moon is the sub-period planet and there is no number 2 present among the competitors.

Negative numbers of the signs:

Aries:        5
Taurus:       3
Gemini:       9
Cancer:       2
Leo:          4
Virgo:        9
Libra:        3
Scorpio:      5
Sagittarius:  6
Capricorn:    1
Aquarius:     1
Pisces:       6


[rluu: See my hand-written notes and annotations on the printed pages of 'The Law Of Periodicity' from this book.  Some of the race results are not consistent with the rules.]

Another system: Hebrew system rulership.

This system employs the positive numbers of the planets.  
The Hebrew day starts at Noon and not Sunrise.

The planet giving its name to the day takes rule over the first hour after noon, and is followed in the Chaldean order by the other planets.  

Each hour is 60 minutes.  Each hour is subdivided into 15 parts of 4 minutes each.  The first 4-minute subperiod is ruled by the same planet as the day, and proceeds in the same Chaldean order.  

pg. 116

Table of hours and subperiods of the week, counted from noon each day (per this second Hebrew system):

Day:       Ruler sesquence, by positive number:
---------  ------------------------------------
Sunday     1657839  [recurring]
Monday     7839165  [recurring]
Tuesday    9165783  [recurring]
Wednesday  5783916  [recurring]
Thursday   3916578  [recurring]
Friday     6578391  [recurring]
Saturday   8391657  [recurring]



The technique for analyzing horses uses 3 factors:
1) Day ruler
2) Hour ruler
3) Subperiod ruler.

Add the positive numbers of the ruler for each of the factors.  Then reduce that sum to its unit value.  The winner of the race should have this unit value.  

pg. 117

Results given in the book are in accord, but sometimes the alternate planet for the unit-value planet wins.  

Mars and Moon are alternates.
Sun and Saturn are alternates.

pg. 118

Hebrew phonetic coding is used for converting the name to numbers, and to the single unit value.  


Rule exception is noted:
"Variability" of the moon: Moon's despositor can win the race.


It is repeatedly observed that the Moon can win in any period whose mass (tide) value (as above [rluu: above?]) agrees with the planet ruling the sign it is in, as follows:

Aries:        9
Taurus:       6
Gemini:       5
Cancer:       2 / 7
Leo:          4 / 1
Virgo:        5
Libra:        6
Scorpio:      9
Sagittarius:  3
Capricorn:    8
Aquarius:     8
Pisces:       3

pg. 119

Correct sunrise time is essential for hour calculations.  


Summary of important points in the Chapter on 'The Law of Periodicity':

The three factors (divisions of a circle):
  Division of circle into 12ths (30 deg angles).
  Division of circle into 6ths  (60 deg angles).
  Division of each quadrant into 6 hours and 7 subsections for each hour
    (4 quadrants * 6 hours * 7 subsections = 168 units).
    (42 units per quadrant).

Importance of correct sunrise time:
  Center of Sun rising is taken as sunrise time.

How to divide the day into hours:
  Sunrise to Noon / 6.
  Noon to Sunset / 6.
  Sunset to Midnight / 6.
  Midnight to Sunrise / 6.

Two different divisions of an hour into subperiods: 
  - Hour divided into 7 subperiods.
  - Hour divided into 15 subperiods.

Various rulers of subperiods, their order of ruling, and the numbers related to them.
