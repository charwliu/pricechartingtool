##############################################################################

Part 1: The Circle

Wealthy person told BA that W.D. Gann used astrology.  BA didn't believe that at first.  He bought Gann's TTTA and Jensen's ACSM.  He bought those two books together (BA says this was about 10 years ago).  It was then that he became convinced that Gann did use astrology.  BA studied a lot of things but had no one to guide him.  

In this field, it's a different type of astrology.  In order to have success in this field you have to a grasp of both astrology and astronomy.  BA has coined a new term: "Astrolonomy", which is a fusion of both astrology and astronomy.  

The goal is to go from knowing nothing to knowing everything you need to know for this field.  You're going to get a good background.  You won't need to go buy the books and waste the time like I had to.  

There's an astrolonomy help file in the WITS archives.  This help file will have the glyphs (or the signs) for the Sun.  You need to know and be able to recognize the glyphs for the signs and the glyphs for the planets.  Know it inside and out.  

rluu: If I want to finish taking notes on this one, start taking notes starting at 5:45 (5 min 45 sec) in the audio.  I stopped taking notes of it because I felt like I probably know most of the material covered in this recording.

Part 2: The Planets

rluu: I didn't listen to this recording. 

##############################################################################

Part 3: Aspects and Houses

Three primary aspect classes:
1) Trines
2) Squares
3) Quintiles

These classes are divided down.  
1) Trines group:   120, 60, 30
2) Square group:   180, 135, 90, 45, 22.5, 11.25
3) Quintile group: 72, 144 

Jensen also has in the quintile group: 9.

You need to memorize these aspect sizes and the classes.
The square group is considered 'bad' by astrologers, and the trine group is considered 'good' by astrologers.  The quintile group is considered to be creative and energetic aspects.  

Take a look at Jensen's book where he uses quintile aspects.  

Aspect is the angular relationship between to objects.  Any two planets are always in angular relationship.  It's just that certain points have special significance.  

Conjunction: aspect of 0 degrees.
Opposition: aspect of 180 degrees.
Square: aspect of 90 degrees.
Semisquare: aspect of 45 degrees.
Sesquiquadrate: aspect of 135 degrees.
Trine: aspect of 120 degrees
Sextile: aspect of 60 degrees.
Semisextile: aspect of 30 degrees.
Inconjunct: aspect of 150 degrees.
Quintile: aspect of 72 degrees.

Typical astrologers just use the above aspects.  In financial astrology, it is important to use those and also include all the aspects on the 15 degree axis (multiples of 15 degrees).

Part 4: Keywords and Cycles

We're going to start off with cycles.

Solar return: Picture in your mind a snapshot of the Sun.  Wherever the Sun is in the zodiac at that instant, it will be again in a year's time.  When it returns to that position again, it is known as a solar return.  

Moon's node: This takes about 18.6 years to complete a revolution.  It is very important in financial astrology.  Watch hits to the natal position made by transiting moon's node.  

25920 years: This is what some people call the 26 thousand year cycle.  It's known as the great year.  It's when the earth and sun return to the same positions in the heavens.  This cycle is responsible for what we call the 'ages', as it is the cycle broken into 12 parts of 2160 years each.  

Eclipse cycle of 18 years:  Check out page 126 of Luther Jensen's ACSM.  

Sunspot cycle: It's very important in this field.  It is 11 years from high to high.  It governs (economic) activity.

Part of Fortune: Formula for it is: (Moon Position) + (Ascendant Position) - (Sun Position)

Planetary time periods: 
  Moon: 4 years
  Mercury: 10 years
  Venus: 8 years
  Sun: 19 years
  Mars: 15 years
  Jupiter: 12 years
  Saturn: 40 years

Reference the book: Mundane Astrology, by Raphael.  This book is in the WITS library.  

Two things that are extremely important to realize:

  There are time periods not to trade through.  

    1) Saturn is known as the planet of separation and constriction.  
    It is known as the 7 year cycle.  
    It's when Saturn squares, opposes, or conjuncts your natal position.  

    Example: Gann was born June 6, 1878.  From page 35 of Wall Street Stock Selector.  "The result was that I continued to make a series of losses until the banks closed in November 1907, and I could not get any more money out of the banks.  I was forced to close out all my commitments with my brokers and take a big loss because I was bucking my own trend.  My period of good luck had run out and I was trading during a period that should have been for rest, recreation and gaining knowledge, instead of trying to make more money which I did not need.  The banks were unable to pay currency for several moneys and I could not get any money to speculate with.  I put in my time studying and figuring on the market and found out what caused my mistake and the losses.  I started trading again in the Spring of 1908.  I should have had some rule to tell me when the trend had turned in my favor."  

    June 6, 1878:  Geocentric Saturn was at 1 Aries 45.
    April 1, 1908: Geocentric Saturn was again at 1 Aries 45.
   
    This is known as a Saturn return.  It starts (the difficulties) about 6 months before the exact aspect.  This coincides exactly with the time period that Gann was talking about in his book.  Never trade during the period of Saturn return or Saturn squaring or opposing your natal Saturn.  Don't trade in the months going into that Saturn square.  Never do it.  It's an unfortunate cycle.  Businesses go through it too.  For our purposes, don't trade through this cycle.  
    
    2) The psychological community calls it the "Mid-life crisis" around the age of 40.  It can be an identity crisis of sorts.  We hit it typically between the ages of 39 to 41.  What causes this is Uranus.  The period of 84 years.  So after 42 years, Uranus is opposing natal Uranus.  Don't trade through this.  The other cycle is Neptune cycle is 164 years.  A quarter of that is roughly 41 years.  So around the same time, these two occur to us simultaneous.  This is a period of a lot of change.  You often hear about husbands, family men, leaving their wives.  And then the cycle wears off, and then they come back on knees.  If you know about this cycle, you won't be tricked.  

    So you don't want to be trading through these mid-life cycle periods.


The rest of this CD contains keywords.  A lot of you may term it personal astrology.  For those of you who are into the astrolonomy of it, get ahold of the Genoa series in WITS.  You're ready for this when you've memorized everything up to this point in the Astrolonomy series.  

Keywords from Jensen in ACSM around pages 39, 40, 41.  Use those keywords for businesses, financial markets, etc.


After the Genoa series, get Turbo 5.  Turbo 5 is free to you on WITS.  From there you have a pretty good foundation.

In financial astrology, BA says he uses ascendant and MC.  

In 45 Years On Wall Street, Gann also states that a man has seasonal cycles.  Seasonal cycles work like this.  It overlaps your birthday.  The weakest point in your seasonal cycle overlaps your birthday.  From that point on, for about a 6 month period, you build up.  Your cycle builds up.  At a period about your 7th month, it starts to drop down.  It continues down till about your birthday.  That's the secret to what Gann states is the seasonal cycle.  He says that that cycle is important for trading.  

This form of analysis is interpretive.  This means this astrology is an art form.  That's what these astrologers are doing is they are squabbling among themselves using different keywords.  That's where the art form comes in... it is more intuitive.  

From Sepharial's Law of Values, pg. 8.  
"Except for the inherent natures of conjoined planets, are mutually antagonistic as Saturn and Mars, Neptune and Uranus, or Mars and Jupiter, we may consider the conjunction as being beneficial in its tendency.  Saturn and Uranus in conjunction produce wars and feuds, depressed stocks and share values, and produce national calamities.  Saturn and Jupiter together brings about useful reforms, constitutional changes, and frequently produces the creation of funds.  Saturn and Mars brings wars, strife, and upheavals.  They always tend to depreciate securities.  Uranus and Jupiter brings about reforms and financial revisions, reconstruction of stocks and new share issues.  Uranus and Mars bring about insurrection and revolts, disturb the existing order of things, thus depleting securities and deflating markets.  Neptune and Jupiter produce unsound flotations, the creation of bogus funds, fraudulent schemes and rigging.  Neptune and any configuration is to be mistrusted, as it tends to produce wildcat schemes or downright fraud.  Mars and Jupiter brings about strong enthusiasm and demonstrations.  So far as markets are concerned, their influence is reflected in a strong bull tendency, highly speculative buying and a run on stocks and shares governed by the sign they occupy.  The opposition of the planets are uniformly evil on their affects on securities, and the fall of share values is always to be seen when the major planets oppose one another.  As witness the recent oppositions of Uranus and Neptune in connection with the stocks and industrial shares of those countries under the influence of Cancer and Capricorn.  The quadratures (square aspects) are of course evil in their affects as the trines and sextiles are good.  But we may lay chief stress upon the nature of the planet occupying the sign.  If Saturn be in the sign, the securities related to that sign may not advance even though Saturn may be well aspected."

Sepharial's real name is Walter Gorn Old.

Part 5: The Systems

There are 3 systems used to measure in Ephemeris'.  The ecliptic, the equator, and the horizon.  We're going to focus on two them.  Specifically the ecliptic and the equator.  The ecliptic uses the true motion of the Earth from the solstices, giving an up and down motion.  

rluu: If I want to finish taking notes on this one, start taking notes at 0:50 (50 seconds).  


##############################################################################

Part 6: The Software

Back in the day everyone used to use ephemeris.  But today we use software.  I want you to get Astrolog.  I have version 5.4.  That's what we'll be using.  I'm doing this with astrolog because it's free.  In reality, I highly recommend Solar Fire.  The reason is that it has an ephemeris that is a lot easier to work with for most people.  It's a lot more user friendly.  

We're going to go through this software and find something interesting.  I'll be referencing Luther Jensen's ACSM.  You need to get this book.  There is a connection between Jensen and Gann.  

ACSM, page 36:
"The change from one sign to another by a planet, coincides with change in trend and general psychology, depending on the magnitude and speed of the planet."

What he means by magnitude and speed of the planet, means that Mercury changing signs will affect the market in a different manner than say Saturn changing signs because Saturn moves a lot slower than the fast speed of Mercury.  Planets changing signs corresponds to changing conditions.  Expect changes around ingress dates of the slower planets (Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, etc.).  Jensen goes into more detail into this on pages 63 and 67 of his book.

BA mentions that Jensen says that Jupiter, Saturn and Uranus affect the Dow.

ACSM pg. 68.
A trigger is a fast moving planet, particularly Mars.

Part 7: Astrolonomy For The Trader

Gann, Jensen and Bayer used this.  

If you move from your book location.  You're being influenced by the location that you currently live in.  

This is known as a relocation chart.  This is a technique that gives you a good idea of what the effects of a certain location will have on you.  If you have moved from your birth location, you are being influenced from your current position, and must operate off that chart.  It's simple to calculate.  Simply plug in your birth date, your birth time, the location you are currently at, but make one change, use the timezone that you were born in.  

Example: 
Individual born at 6:52 pm on Feb 14, 1944, in Destin (rluu: spelling?) Florida, USA, would be EST of +5:00.  And would have Ascendant of about 0 Virgo.  

In August of 1962, when transition Uranus conjuncting his natal ascendant, the individual moves to San Bernadino, California.  Plug in Feb 14, 1944, plug in birth time of 6:52 pm, using San Bernadino, California, then select Eastern Standard Time of +5:00.  With the new chart the new ascendant is about 5 Leo 38.  As long as the individual resides in San Bernadino, California, this chart will be in effect.  

It will be found that this will shift, and the new stock or commodity will need to be found.  

The individual is governed by the locations laws laid down by Jensen's in ACSM, and amplified in the work "12".  

This is known as a relocation chart.  

There's a check to make sure you've done this right.  In the original chart, write down the moon position.  Then in the new chart, write down the moon chart.  The moon should be at the same position.  

The individual has it's ups and downs just like a stock or commodity.  An individual is governed by the same things that affect a stock or commodity.  

When a planet goes retrograde, it slows down and holds a degree for period of time.  In that slowing down, it intensifies, and it's effects are intensifies.  If it's in a sweet spot, then the situation in the person's life will be critical (if it's a hard aspect).  The sweet spot is roughly within 1 deg 30 min to 1 deg 10 min to exact aspect.  These are often difficult times to be trading.  For example, for a square aspect of 90 degrees, between 88 deg 30 min to 88 deg 50 min, things will be very difficult if a planet is moving slowly there.  


Cast the following chart:
August 21, 1969
10:36 pm    Central Daylight Time (+5:00)
Springfield, Illinois, USA
39 N 47
89 W 39

Note the position of Neptune in this natal chart at 26 Scorpio.  Now transiting Saturn in November 2006, was applying a square to this natal Neptune position.  As you can see by casting charts through the month of November, transiting Saturn was indeed slowing down, i.e. intensifying, and finally turning retrograde on December 5th.  

Rule: The slower the planet, the more intense its effects.  

What you should do is cast these charts and watch these aspects coming into November.  You'll see a large difference because it's slowing down and intensifying.

In Turbo 1, I gave you a natal of a stock.

Another critical time I have observed that traders should stay out of the markets is when an outer transiting planet is conjunct, square or opposed the ascendant of the individual.  The following planets are included: Saturn, Chiron, Uranus, Neptune, Pluto, and sometimes Mars.  When this happens to individuals (these planets and these aspects to natal ascendant), you are taking a hit to your health.  Even if you're in tip-top prime condition, external forces are generally draining you around these times.  Meaning, whatever is demanding your attention will demand your focus.  Stay out of the markets when this stuff is coming up.  The reason for it is that the aspect isn't going to get you, but the life circumstances will make it so you can't concentrate.  I've made dramatic errors around these times.  If I had known these simple set of circumstances that I am showing you, I could have avoided huge losses.  Now I write down these dates and I block them out.  Some will ignore me, but I'm just trying to help you out.  

Jensen in ACSM on page 48 has rotation conjunction of Jupiter and Saturn.  But he never goes to explain how to use these.  Well, I found the method in some old material from Sepharial, and what you do is you cast the chart, but you set the location to the capital of the country of where that stock or commodity that you're trading.  In the example he used Washington DC, USA, which is the capital of the USA.  And you watch when the solar arc ascendant makes aspects.  The reason why he did this here... and there's an even better way of doing this nowadays because the cycles have changed.... but back in 1921, Jupiter and Saturn ruled the financial markets, specifically the Dow and the stock market.  When ascendant made aspects to Jupiter and Saturn, it was really important.  Sepharial used these in solar arcs.  Nowadays, for timing the financial markets, it doesn't have the power that it once did, because the cycles themselves have changed.

Let's go to some writings of Jensen that's not in his book... this is from 1932:
"In the beginning and for all general indications thereafter, use only those charts that involve the major planetary conjunctions, in particularly the mutation and rotational conjunction maps of Jupiter and Saturn.  Follow these with their solar return maps.  In progressing, use the method of the ancients which is the diurnal map based on the solar return of the major conjunction maps.  Phenomenal results will accrue so far as general economic events and trends are concerned.  The minor trend can be located by correlating the solar ingress maps for each year with the lunation and lunar quadrate maps of each month.  In looking for the indications marking the general economic trend in 1933, it is found that six major aspects will occur between the important slow moving planets.  Five quincent aspects and one trine.  Of the quincent aspects, three are 150 each, and other are 210 each.  The trine are 240 aspect.  Note, compute these aspects in a clockwise motion with the faster moving planet as significator.  There are no major adverse aspects happening during 1933, although several researchers might offer several which are rejected in the methods used by the ancients in computing aspects.  Adding to the foregoing configurations, the solar eclipse at 5 Pisces 28 on February 24th, and the solar eclipse at 27 Leo 44, on August 21st.  Mercury is stationary 6 times, Mars is 2 times, Jupiter is 2 times, Saturn is 2 times, Uranus is 1 time, and Neptune 2 times.  There are 4 quarterly ingress figures, 12 lunation figures, and several minor conjunctions.  The general interpretation is the outlook is optimistic and bullish, with the general economic trend pointed to definite recovery, particularly in the last half of the year.  The 150 degree or in the reversed order, 210 degree major aspects, are related to the 6th and 8th houses of a mundane chart, involving the conditions of work, service, employment, agriculture.  Accenting these configurations is the 240 degree trine of Jupiter and Saturn, which culminates on October 26th, involving in aspect 9th house matters of shipping, commerce, foreign relations, education, publishing, radio, law, etc.  If the student will fit these configurations into the major past conjunction figures and their diurnal solar return figures, little difficulty should be experienced in timing the general economic trend in picking up several of the important economic barometers."

Going on a different part that he's written...
"In astro-economic prediction, the foregoing comments particularly apply.  A specific day-to-day results are expected.  In mundane analysis, the writer has found that there are several times each year where vibrations are particularly potent in connection with the world's happenings.  Charts set on the foregoing methods have formed the basis for an exception record of accuracy of prediction.  The most important points are the two times each year when the ecliptic crosses the celestial equator, termed the autumna equinox and the vernal equinox; the summer and winter ingress points are minor.  Then at each of the 12 lunations, additional strong vibrational charges are impressed on the Earth, which reveal the minor indications for the month that follow.  Diurnal revolution charts based on these several points of polarization reveal the daily mundane indication."  

Personal astrology:
When a planet changes houses, like a planet moves from the 4th to the 5th house, or from the 8th to the 9th house.  When a planet changes it's houses, it corresponds to changing conditions in the person's life.  Go back to major changes in your life.  When you went to college, or when your spouse moved in with you, or when you took a job somewhere else, etc.  If you go back to those years, you'll find that a planet changed houses.  The slower moving planets have greater potency here, and correspond to greater changes.  An example of this is Pluto; you always notice when Pluto changes a house, especially if Pluto is crossing an angle to ascendant or MC.  These are great periods of change.  Another one is Uranus is opposing or conjuncting the ascendant or MC.  There's also other changes, like for Neptune or Jupiter.  Your life will be affected when a planet changes signs, and you need to be aware of those.  In those changes of life, a lot of those changes will require your attention, and will take your attention away from trading.  

Something Jensen wrote in 1932, which BA hasn't ever given out publicly:
"Statistics on the cycles of the United States to approximate 27 years in total, after considering the minor swings or small cycles within the major cycle.  By taking the horoscope of the United States and checking the interaction in transit of Jupiter, Saturn, and Uranus, with this chart, the configurations plainly indicate exact agreement with statistical history."

BA: What he means by 'statistical history' is charts, or market charts.

"It is the addition of Neptune to the interaction of Jupiter, Uranus and Saturn, which constitutes the key to the major cycle indications, and as much as the stock market is the mirror of the cyclical swings, it follows that the student should have no difficulties in picking in advance, the major bull periods and the major depression periods.  Taken for granted that the student is sufficiently advanced to work with mundane figures, his understanding of the individual natures of the signs and the blending of the planets involved."

BA: That's very important what he says there, because in his book ACSM, he doesn't mention that to you.  He leaves it out.  He figures he'd be giving you too much in his book, so he put it here instead.  

How are you going to set up these tests, that's the question.  You've been helped along enough here with this series, you shouldn't have too many problems. 

In personal astrolonomy, what's important here is to know when changes are coming up.  Especially the size and magnitude of the changes.  The reason for this is because some of these changes are extremely difficult to trade through and you need to know what is going on.  

Whenever anything happens to you, I want you to look and try to find it in the chart.  I've been doing this for a long time, and I assure you, it'll be there.  It'll be a big relief because you'll know when that aspect will be exact, and when it will be over.  You'll know the duration.  

This will save you money, it'll keep you from making errors.  

Continuing on with Jensen...
"This forecast was based on the cyclical charts, which indicated as early as 1928, the crisis extending from 1929 to 1932.  The major afflictions of these charts, based on the last conjunction of Saturn and Uranus, the Great Mutation, and 3 past eclipses, began to subside in period of March and April 1932.  The diurnals, lunation figures, and natals involved in this latter period, pointed to March 17th as the logical first market bottom.  And the action of the market on March 17th actually confirmed this interpretation by going to a new low during the day, then reversing its major trend and closing after a rally 2 to 5 points in most issues.  Yet on March 31st 1932, the upturn from low of March 17th was drastically reversed and one of the most severe declines in the history of this bear market began.  Setting aside the fact that an national financial journal, under date of April 25th 1932, stated that technically the bear market was over, between March 17th and the 23th of March, and recovery was definitely underway by March 30th.  The fact remains that another decline took place [BA: He's talking about the decline to July 9th, 1932].  We will also disregard the report now coined by leading statistical services that the tide of depression was turned against further depression the last week in March and the general statistical indices made bottom in the same period.  These statements confirm our observation of the ending of the first crisis, but it does not conclude with the actions of the markets since the last of March.  To us the error was of interpretation rather than a lack of astrological indications.  In an analysis of the astrological indications it seems plain that with the passing of the major afflictions, it was justifiable to base the conclusion that general conditions would be relieved, and therefore enter into an improvement stage.  However the economic patient was not in a condition to withstand any additional buffeting, particularly just as the crisis was passing, however, on March 18th, a transiting Mars reached an opposition to the natal stock exchange Mars in a conjunction with the place of the annual eclipse of the Sun of March 7th, 1932, in the second decan of Pisces."

BA: What's going on there is he has got this eclipse that is tying into a point in the natal of the NYSE.  He's saying Mars is firing this off.  

"First make a list and compute all the major eclipses which are still in effect, their positions, and the length of time they will remain in effect.  Data on this may be had from "Dictionary of Astrology", "Eclipses in Theory and Practice", and the "Solar Epoch", all by Sepharial.  Note that the important eclipse of May 19th, 1928, in effect until 1935, is located in Taurus 28 degrees.  This will perhaps give a clue as to reasons for certain sensitive points in planetary interactions affecting economics since 1928."

BA:  So what I'm doing here, and the reason why I was giving that to you, is so that you have some things to test.  The key to this field really is testing.  The more you test, the more experience you will gain.  

BA:  I'll tell you something.  Eclipses, as far as financial markets goes, they do have an affect.  I don't use them, and I know people that are super successful in financial markets, and they don't use eclipses either.  The reason why that was included is to let you know some of the techniques he was using.  He was also using diurnals.  We've seen TAC make market calls based off of diurnals.  Where can we get information on this?  There's two jpeg files (diu1.jpeg and diu1.jpeg) in the WITS yahoo files section that describe how to do diurnals.  Jensen was very big on them.  That's why Jensen had those rotational charts there in his book, and that's why in his book Jensen's got the Sun marked off to the minute, is so he could do solar returns, and he could do diurnals and all that stuff.  You have to have all those locations very precise to be able to do that.  That's why Jensen is giving all of that.  

A lot of these guys that are reading his book, when they come across that stuff, they don't have a clue as to what Jensen is talking about.  The reason they don't is because they don't have the proper background.  They haven't studied the material that has been presented in these seven lessons.  You have an advantage over them.  Put in the time, and this field will reward you handsomely.  

Regarding trading into the mid-life crisis periods, one guy had $250,000 cash walking into the mid-life cycle, and going out, he had only a few hundred bucks.  If you don't know about these personal cycles, it can cost you dearly.  I'm the type of person that wants to know.  

From ACSM, page 131:
"As a final comment, this text requires step by step study.  Casual readers will be unable to follow parts of the text, and proceed to take a critical stance that this is just another book.  It is not, but some key factors are scattered throughout the text.  Herein is the complete skeleton of the results of 54 years of research and study which included 45 years as a professional analyst.  Many long time clients have insisted for the past ten years that my personal methods of interpretation should be recorded for others who are sincere students searching income and security in perhaps the most exploited money melange in our society -- speculative markets."

BA: If this was a con-game, why the hell would he write that?  He would be misleading a lot of people.  He's not misleading people.  This is a serious field; he points it out there.  

BA: Jensen worked for Gann, and was paid by Gann until Gann's death in 1955.  Subsequently, Jensen started new work in 1957.  Jensen lived very well, as our investigator found out.  All that is in a report on the WITS solaris site.  Go to www.wheelsinthesky.com and go into those archives there, and you'll see the report from the private investigator that we hired, to track down information on who exactly this guy was.  Jensen lived very well, and the investigator talked to people who knew Jensen back in the 1930s who are still alive.  

BA: Jensen is serious in this book.  That's why I recommend the book.  I recommend a careful study of this book.  

BA: There is also personal astrology in the book.  There's a method in here; it is what I referred to earlier, of geographical location.  It's extremely important.  I've never seen it fail... never.  I've done at least 100 of these things.  I've always see it to the 'T', it always shows up as being on the mark.  Those methods are on pages 27 to 30.
