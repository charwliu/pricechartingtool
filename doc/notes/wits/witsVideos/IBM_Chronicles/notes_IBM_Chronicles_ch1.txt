Money-Time principle:

Money is no good without time (to spend it).
Time is no good without Money (living in fear with no income).


With Gann, you put in the time upfront and you collect down the road.  

How long is it going to take me?  Depends on factors:
- Time to put in. 
- Personal drive.


Down the road, there is a safe haven, where you time pays off.

1994, at age 25, decided to make a career out of financial markets.  Over the next three years, he went over everything he could find.  

That all stopped when he came across W.D. Gann.


All that time, he was searching for the truth, but he didn't know it at the time.  

BA arrived at TTTA, on April 1, 1997.

Gann came from a place of knowledge.
BA's understanding of Gann has evolved over time.  
BA is still learning in stages, in time.

Gann understood the true value of knowledge.  He wanted you to work for the truth over time.

To address this issue of learning over time.

1) Video (Master List @ Yahoo Files).
2) Genoa Series (Yahoo Files Section).
3) Astrolonomy Audios (Solaris Site).
4) "Instructor Series" email BA at: thebay4@aol.com


Law of vibration is about Octaves.  Without a proper octave training, you're not going to get it.  You need the proper background.  Octaves are handled in the instructor series.  


Goal is 100% accuracy in trading.  
Most Gann traders trade around 85-95 percent accuracy.  
Strive to be 100%.

The natural progression of a gann trader:
Start off with one system, and develop it over time.
Eventually, you'll see the light at the end of the tunnel.


Around 2000, BA joined internet forums on Gann.
Personal astrology, BA believes in it's importance.  
Back then, these vendors just wanted you to buy their stuff.  
With these vendors, when you charge money for WITS, they don't join the site.


Over the years, the Gann field has changed drastically.
All of that was around the 2000 time area.  Since the inception of WITS, things have changed.


Gann's true systems are in TTTA.  

Gann holds that the present is a repetition of the past.
Ecclesiastes 1:9.
What has been will be again, what has been done will be done again; there is nothing new under the sun.

Gann left behind a phenomenal trading record.  He died in 1955.  Here we are here now, still studying his methods.  That's the power of truth.  

The truth will stand up over time.  


The Repetition Solution.
How does history repeat from the past?  This is where the book TTTA comes in.  TTTA provides those answers; those keys, those solutions.  


Anyone teaching you the truth will be referenching TTTA.  They will be very well-versed in TTTA.

[Foreword]

Casual reading of TTTA will not produce results.

The valuable secret is written in veiled language. 

The market trader needs to transform into a decoder.  <--- ****

The learning and decoding takes place in stages.  

Last 14 months and counting, BA has been working on the decoding.  

There are parts of TTTA that are much easier to see and understand.

There are posts in WITS that are called the TM posts.

This field is about taking baby steps over time.  It's about a slow natural progression to success.  Not a fast lightning bolt.  

The way to understand gann is through TTTA, and that's done in steps and stages.  

The true cause of all market activity is the cycles.  A trader with a accurate cycle or two should expect to do a lot better than those without them.  

Once a cycle is found, there is a progression on improvement and understanding, to enhance the accuracy of the cycle.  

When you look at a market chart, you are looking at the cycles.  If you can't forecast and trade, it's because you don't understand the cycles.  


June and July 2012, posted an old system that TAC and BA used and made money on.  

There is a relationship between an individual and the stock or commodity that you're trading.  Look for someone/something that you're harmonious with.  


Sometimes the relationship is beneficial, and you can make consistent profits with them.  There are some stocks and commodities you'll not be able to make money out of them.  

That's one factor that determines the amount of profitability that you will have over time.  


For BA, With IBM, profits and research came relatively easy.  

A path to lead to success.  (called the IBM series).  

When you are looking at a market chart, you are looking at cycles, you are looking at repeats from the past.  

Gann was well known for his forecast.  Anybody out there that really truly understands Gann, will have the ability to forecast.
