The dominant cycle in IBM is the St. Marie from TTTA.  


The cycles need to be found and they need to be worked with.  He put the cycles to be used with the financial markets in TTTA.

pg. 287.
The news was quickly flashed to General Pearson's headquarters.  on examination they found the giant ship was a mother ship more than 600 feet long, bearing the name "Tokyo J-1".  

J-1 may mean Jupiter - 1, equals Mars.  

Then you become convinced the cycle is Mars / Jupiter.  Then you understand the cycle has to have a length of repeat.  That must be where the 600 feet of Mars/Jupiter as 600 degrees long.  

Have I found a cycle?  You should be able to answer your own question cycle.  

You're going to have the tools to check it yourself.  


1) These types of cycles (in this video) are called "Cycle Of Repetition" or CORS for short.  

2) COR's are Heliocentric or Moon based.  No retrograde motion.  

3) A correct COR for a stock or commodity will have inversions fallin ign the right places. (This is how we KNOW we are correct.)

Additional information not in the video:
Where are these places (of these inversions)?  In the book Bayer's book Handbook of Trend Determination.  It's in the WITS site, archives, where the files are.  
Let's begin assembling cycles so that we can test our theories.  

Formula: 
<faster_moving_planet> + 360 - <slow_moving_planet>


Aug 21, 2002
Apr 17, 2006
Jan  1, 2010

With the COR, you never go low to low, or high to high.  You always go high to low and low to high.  


Aug 22, 2002 High
Sept 4, 2002 Low
Sept 11, 2002 High 
Sept 13, 2002 Low
Sept 17, 2002 High
Sept 24, 2002 Low

Apr 19, 2006 High
Apr 24, 2006 Low
Apr 27, 2006 High
May 2, 2006 Low
May 12, 2006 High
May 19, 2006 Low
 
Jan 4, 2010 High
Jan 7, 2010 Low
Jan 8, 2010 High
Jan 13, 2010 Low
Jan 19, 2010 High
Jan 22, 2010 Low
Jan 28, 2010 High
Jan 29, 2010 Low
Feb 3, 2010 High


This is the color coding system that BA uses:

Highs marked as Green.
Lows marked as Red.
Inversions marked Pink.



Tubing: Connecting columns.


How much orb do you use?  Use 2 days either side.  
So for these COR cycles, the total width is about 5 days. 


Adding May 5, 2006 and May 8, 2006.

How do you know you ahve the right cycle?
Your total inversion rate needs to be below 20%.  (of total pivots).
Your total inversion rate needs to be higher than 10%.  (of total pivots).


Homework:  
Do about a year of turns.  
Sept 24, 2002 to Sept 24, 2003.
Then have a look at your inversion rate.  

Then email the results to:

These IBM webinars will always be on Thursday and around 2:00 pm [CST].

St. Marie is valid for the NIFTY (Indian index).
