BA's average gain in 2013: 137 percent per trade.
No losses.
[rluu_20131219: 137, any relation to Supreme Commander Gordon?]

BA's no trade zone: July to October.


That's extremely important, knowing when not to trade.


Cycle pivot was on Thursday, but Friday was lower in IBM.  Why?  That's where this tool will come in handy.  

BA knew no inversion was due on Monday, and we're going to go up.  BA had a price confirmation on Thursday.

W.D.Gann made annual forecasts which were made available for a fee to clients.


Gann knew which cycles would be repeated from the past.  

Supply and Demand Letter.

Sometimes prices are included, sometimes they are not.

1929 annual stock forecast.

The forecast always goes high-low-high-low, etc.

He would miss one or two inversions a year.

The forecast comes from a longer time period that BA calls the "master sheet".

The forecast posted in WITS for December was posted two months ago.

The IBM series is not at the price level in Wits.  You gotta get time right before we get price.


These are in the video:

IBM 2014 January to June:
Jan 1
Jan 7
Jan 14
Jan 21 (Careful, inversion, could not confirm)


Feb 3

May 13 (careful, orb?)
[... Get the rest of the dates.]


These have orb and inversion are taken care of.  These dates are done.


July 2, of 2016, whatever.


The IBM forecasts come from cycles.

These cycles were worked with in IBM Chronicles chapter 2.  



How do we know these lines are not correct?
May 2, 2011  H
May 5, 2011  L
May 12, 2011 H


Look at the price activity when the lines are actually drawn correctly.

These actual physical turns can be hidden.

The line is more than just a simple line.  That's far as i went in the actual video (not the webinar).  What that line really is, is in George Bayer's book: George Wollsten.  

Respecting the line.  Price respects this line.  There's more to it.  These can be used to find actual cycle pivots.

Lets' take a look at current conditions and how the line changes things.  

Wheels within wheels.

Special offer.  [1:03:50]

Webinar coming up, invitation only event.  Only being told about now.

It's free.
2:00 pm, just like this one.
Advanced cycles class.  
Limiting it to 20 people.

The requirement is you have to email thebay4@aol.com.

Homework:
Do 5 years of doing this line, on your own stock or commodity.

The reason for that is what it'll do, is it'll get you used to this.


No trading zones, how to calculate them?  You need the astrological background.
www.ciclico.org.
There are also must-trade zones.

BA has his own no-trade zone rules.
Never trade when transiting Saturn is in aspect to natal Saturn.


BA only uses trading days when drawing the lines which price respects.
BA doesn't know if it works with calendar days.

MetaStock is what BA uses and it does the scaling automatically... whatever it wants.

Some of these turns [in IBM] are lunar some are medium.


For trade triggers:
BA uses Gann's angle of repetition, for where price will go.
BA uses the line.

BA doesn't enter or exit a trade unless he knows where that line is.

The two main factors to pay attention to:
What makes the tubes look good, and what makes the line look good.

Question: Does setting [...] [1:21:40]
You can use Gann's angle of repetition to get Gann's price point.
And draw the line in.  Price should respect the line going into the next cycle pivot.

What's causing the box moves are a smaller cycle.  [1:28:00 ish].  BA says he knows the cycle, but he does not pay attention to it.  


Special way to trade.  When combined with a stock that likes you, will enable you to grow a trading account like you wouldn't believe.  Special formula for how to do it for how much to put into each trade.  People get into trouble not following this.
