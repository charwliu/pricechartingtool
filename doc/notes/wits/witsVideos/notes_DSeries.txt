# Notes on BA's WITS videos called D1.avi, D2.avi, D3.avi, D4.wmv, D5.wmv.

D1.avi
Video is length: 11:59  (11 mins, 59 secs).

This video covers Citicorp, starting in 1995.  

Eye'ballin the stock, drawing out the cycle of about 7-12 days in length.

What you want to do is ferreting out the cycles.  THat's what this field is all about.  There are various kinds of cycles.  They are listed in Turbo 2.

Day counts can be used too.  That is very basic.  

How can I make a million from this technique?  You can't, unless you absolutely luck out.  You're going to take this, and you're going to have to work with this, and overcome the problems that are inherent with this.  It's meant for you to see what's really going on there.  It's so you won't be stuck wild theories in left field about how markets work.  Marks are cyclical.  That's what Gann had in his books.  That's what he wrote about, cycles.  This is one type of cycle, there's different types of cycles out there.  Each type of cycle (for example, this cycle compared a natal cycle), has it's own mechanics and its own parameters, and it operates differently.  But each one of them also has its secrets, and it's in the use of that, that these gets interesting.  But you need a platform to start off from.  Remember that in this field, it's all about the cycles.

D2.avi
Video is length: 16:07  (16 mins, 07 secs).

This video covers Soybeans.  Taking running day counts.  Does a commodity really work similar to stock or is it really a myth?  

Starting around June 2002.  Roughly 10 day cycle.  Talking about the dynamics involved in the weekends.  Sometimes if you can't really be sure about a pivot, go to the next pivot and test it out to see.  BA doesn't know what's behind this, but he says he's good at counting days, so hopefully we are pretty close.  

Knowing when inversions come in, plus the cycle date to the day, you'd have a powerful system there.  A few points where it was 13 days, and a few where it's about 6 days.  There's a cause for that.

D3.avi
Video is length: 14:18  (14 mins, 18 secs).

XAO, an Australian future or stock (BA's not sure).  Looks like about an 8 to 13 day cycle.  BA is eye-balling and drawing in cycles for this.  Pay attentiont o momentum changes that hint to a cycle pivot. 

A weekend could be a high, but then if the price keeps moving up and then pivots down, maybe the price destination over the weekend could have been much much higher, but then it's moving down, but what we may see in actual data is the monday's price moving up instead of starting to go down.  But then after monday, it goes down.  

Partway into the video, he starts counting the cycle going backwards.

D4.wmv
Video is length: 17:19  (17 mins, 19 secs).

Australian stock: NCM
Starting at the data at January 1994. 

Cycle averages 6 to 8 days.  We're going to take it through.

Inversions can trip you up.  Becoming a cycle master, you'll just see the same setups over and over again... like the 1 day counter-trend pivot.  

What you do with your original run-through is you don't worry about getting all the inversions... just try based on your own cycle knowledge, to get it lined up as much as possible.  You need to have experience with getting the cycle hashed out as good as possible.  

Example, in the July, August 1994 area, it's easy to lose your cycle.  Because there's a lot of chop.  See video about 5:45.  

If the date is outside of our cycle parameters (orb), then we know the pivot is caused by another cycle.  

This is just the run through so what we draw out might not be correct.  We can go back and look more closely.  There's different layers or levels of analysis.  

Lots of inversions in the May and June area.  You'll hit pockets where this happens.

D5.wmv
Video is length: 20:43  (20 mins, 43 secs).

Australian stock covered: NCM

Larger cycle covered.   [rluu: I think BA has a list of dates for the cycle being due and he is drawing in the turns that map up closely to those pivots].

There are many good american stocks around the 100+ area of price, whereas in australia many of them are in the 30's range of price.  BA's not sure why that is.  [rluu: I think BA's talking about stocks with cycles and good price moves.]

NCM behaves more like an American stock, that's why BA likes it.  

Starting at Feb 1991.  

If you expect it to go up and it goes sideways, that means there is still a lot of pent up momentum in the direction.  So when the next pivot happens after the sideways move, it's going to be big and fast.  

No cycle exists by itself.  [rluu: Meaning, this means they influence each other.]

At some points, you might get whippsawed if you only trade off of one cycle.  Well, some turns are caused by other cycles, so you need to find more than one cycle so that doesn't happen to you.  That's the way Gann traded.  

Notice how price bounces off the line (on the slightly larger cycle).  

Pattern seen often: 
Sideways price move into a pivot low, then a waterfall dive down caused by an inversion to a low again.  See October 1995, at 17:30 in the video.
