BA reminiscing:

WITS has been around 12 years ago.
The landscape in this field was totally different.  The field was wrecked by vendors that didn't understand anything much about W.D. Gann.  Many vendors didn't care about Gann, they just wanted to change their stuff.  
That's changing; that has changed over the years.

BA was approached to do a site prior to WITS.  It needed a place where people come together and pool information.  Those that are ahead, and have been in this field for a while, can actually share, so that others can get ahead very quickly.

BA: Got into Gann late 1996.
BA: Got Tunnel April 1, 1997.

Back then, you were left in the dark about what to study, etc.  There wasn't proof back then that Gann wasn't a complete scam.  One of the foundations of WITS was to pool everything together.  In that time since WITS started, you've seen a lot of people come up.  They are trading W.D. Gann's techniques.  

Looking back, BA is very happy with the field in general.  It's not just WITS, but there is a change in this field.  In the early years of WITS, there was a lot of people in the "gimmie (give-me)" crowd.  They just wanted to make a lot of money, and they didn't want to study or learn anything.  

Reflecting back, BA feels very happy about WITS mission statement.  WITS has achieved, and has continued to achieve the mission goal of WITS.  It has helped pool information together for other members.



Continuing on in the webinar...

[BA is bringing up the chart for IBM stock price, Nov. 2012 to Feb 2013.].  

The red line [in the chart] is the cycles we've been tracking.  The IBM series was actually started by Peter from TAC, applying a type of cycle to IBM in June-July of 2012.  So you can go back in WITS and find those.

In early August 2012, BA did some time cycle work in IBM, and realized showing as much of the time cycle work in WITS would help some on their way (illuminating the way).  He began posting it into WITS.  A lot of this stuff is done behind the scenes (e.g. orb).  Generally the orb systems were tested in the background.  So what we did was we tested them in real time and showed them in WITS.  There are a couple of different orb systems.  He's trying to show the path (of study) on the board, with the IBM series.  

Having price doesn't do you any good unless you have orb solved.  

No cycle exists by itself.  There are different cycles, and they have to be combined.  (Composite).  That's what you're seeing in IBM.  Cycles combined.  

The orb solution is cycle-dependent.  For example, the St. Marie has a orb solution.  MAM cycle has one.  Tokyo J-1 has one.  They all have their orb solutions.  They are cycle-dependent.

After the orb solution is applied, generally, we're not more than a day off.  In the beginning, when we started IBM, we had 2 days on either side.  That's still a big orb, and not to the point where you could really trade it.  Then we applied the orb system, and then it went to 1 day on either side.  Then now we have the turn pretty much on the day.  

BA called 2 inversions in August 7th, 2012.  It was a double-inversion.  Inversions happened in two cycles at the same time.  BA nailed it.  But he didn't post that in WITS.  BA missed an inversion in January.  Gann sometimes missed one or two inversions a year.  WHat happened with BA, BA was timing an inversion with a pivot, and he missed it.  

When these inversions come up, you have rules for them, where you can flip the trade.  So the forecast can be wrong, but you can flip the trade and still make money.  There's opportunities.

There are different kinds of cycles:
The one Peter posted was called a straight cycles.  Those are good starter cycles.  Nothing wrong with them.  The best type of cycle is the Cycle of Repetition (COR), or Time Cycles... whatever you want to call them.  The reason is because they tie into the price matrix in a specific type of way.  That's why I think it's the best type of cycle.  

LOV: it's shorthand.  Not used in the IBM post series to date.  



The goal of the IBM series later became 2-fold:

1) The first goal was to show the path for the Gann student to have success.  Step by step progress.

2) To use the "Doolittle" principle.  In WWII, in order to begin the retalliation on Japanese for the bombing of Pearl Harbor.  Jimmy Doolittle was given the job of getting the bombers able to fly off the short deck of an aircraft carrier.  It had never been done before.  

What he started doing was started practicing getting these planes off, not an aircraft carrier, but on a normal runway.  He drew a line where a normal aircraft carrier would normally end.  What started to happen, was, one by one, these planes would started "rolling the line".  What this means is when they went past the line, the wheels were still on the runway and not in the air.  If it was an aircraft carrier, then the planes would have gone into the oceans.  They started to doubt that it could be done.

Then Jimmy DoLittle, went and showed them how it was done.  He showed them it was possible.  Then when the other pilots went and did it, then time after time, they were in the air when they crossed the line... everyone else could do it.  

-->  It was the BELIEF THAT THEY COULD SUCCEED, was what changed.  That it could be done.  

That's what BA called the "DoLittle" principle.  Getting out in front and leading by example.  

BA felt that he had to give leadership... to apply the Doolittle principle.  BA gets private emails from people, and he showed the cycles of the IBM series to one person, and he was shocked that that was what it was coming from... like it was something so simple that originally didn't think he could do.


From this point in understanding cycles, we're not yet rushing into price.  There is still more work with understanding orb.  If you try to get into price too early, you won't have all the components in place (time and orb) in order to get price, so you'd just burn yourself out.  

At this point in the path, we are simply looking at the time cycles.  All this forecast, this Feb. forecast, the March forecast, came from September of 2012.  Not one thing was changed in these cycles.  The orb is done on a monthly basis.  But the cycle pivots, the mean pivots that come from the time cycles, no changes were made.  

You don't change the cycle dates as you're going...  If you're changing the cycles or cycle dates as you're going, then you've got the wrong cycle.

The March IBM forecast, was posted on December 13, 2012.  The original post was WITS #63065.  There were no changes in that forecast.  

W.D. Gann said it is just as easy to forecast a few years ahead as it is to forecast 100 years in advance.  

To forecast from last September (forecasts were created in September), I must have the right cycles that Gann used.

Generally traders a whole focus on price.  If price can be predicted, large profits should follow.  I [BA] understand this logic, but I believe that premise is flawed.  Gann taught that time is more important than price.  The reason for this is because price is a function of time, and price can only be understood through an understanding of time.  Therefore the current goal of the IBM series is to get the time component correct, via the time cycles first.  

Each forecasted high and low pivots has a specific price point that it is heading to.  It's knowable and calculatable in advance.  But I'll tell you what, if the time component is wrong, then you can throw the price component out the window.  That's why we're focusing on time.

Not only are we running off of a forecast 6 months old now, but we haven't even got the good cycles aren't operational yet!  There's an internal mechanism (although we knew about it in September), we didn't put it into the cycle work.  Why?  Because you aren't going to know the internal mechanism when you're at this point in the path.  You'll learn the internal mechanism later through the working with the cycles.  The internal mechanism makes it a lot easier to put the cycles together... it helps you put the cycles together  So we did 6 months of forecasting to see what accuracy we coul d get without the internal mechanism.  Our accuracy has been okay.  Next step isn't price, instead we want to start working with these cycles to get it better.  We want to start working with the internal mechnism to get it better. 

The red line (with all highs and lows) is a composite of cycles.  

Important concept:  If the cycle pivot is wrong, the price point cannot be accurately forecasted!  

There are different types of cycles written about by various authors.  The IBM series from early August 2012 uses the cycles out of W.D. Gann's book, TTTA.  Specifically, the U.S. Government cycle combined with the St. Marie.  

These cycles are of the nature that they directly link into the price structure.  Meaning that each pivot has a specific price point that is knowable through the time element.  Therefore, if we don't have the time component correct, the price isn't going to go to where we think it is... we'd be wasting our time.  

There are different types of cycles.  Peter and TAC talked about one, in June-July of 2012.  


BA is an options trader.  

Now... in IBM, you're seeing some areas of slop out there... where these cycles, they're not coleasing correctly.  That's fine, we're not 100% yet.  Not only are we using the stuff that is 6 months old, but there is an upgrade.   This is the the "internal mechanism", and we didn't configure this into the cycle when the forecast was done, although we were aware of it.  

So we're going to wait until the April forecast comes out, before we incorporate the internal mechanism.

BA says after the cycle work is done, it is only 2 or 3 times a day checking the stock (totaling a few minutes a day).  How long did the cycle work take?  How hard was the cycle work?  It took an afternoon (for 6 months of forecasting).  


BA uses E-trade to trade.  


[Excerpt of an email letter shown that he received from a WITS member.]  

"I have been using angles in the following way:  I track a first impulse (a HIGH for instance) in a pattern that is developing or already developed and calculate it as angle 4x1 or 8x1, then I derive all other angles (3x1, 2x1, 1x1, 1x2, 1x3, 1x4, 1x8).  I don't know how Gann did it, but I do find consistently that turns occur in angles calculated that way (attached IBM graph shows how price high today, so far, stopped just at an angle, maybe just an intraday correction in an ongoing uptrend).  I think it has to do with "proportions", as just was discussed on board, an original impulse or initial pattern, tells a lot of the complete pattern that is to develop."

[End excerpt of email letter.]


BA: He's trying to get his mind around what is going on.  He's got the key word here right.  This word is "PROPORTION".  Another important word he got right, "PATTERN".  Even though we're still working on time (in the IBM series), it doesn't mean that price is not important.  So this webinar is about what people do can right now today, to combining these cycles right now, with price.  That's what the genesis of what this webinar is about.  


The price points can only be understood through the correct cycles.  

From where you are at (in the Gann path), the wheel of 24, is far far more important to you right now than the square of 9.  For where 99% of you who are attending this webinar.  

There are different reasons for this [wheel being the most important for you right now], with one of them being the way that TTTA is coded!  You need to know the wheel of 24 first.  Revelations 4:4, talks about 24 elders.  This wheel of 24 needs to be understood those that go down the path of the Gann trader.  It's extremely important.  It's the most important wheel.  

In his book, TTTA, W.D. Gann talks about Tunnels.  These are price tunnels.  An example would be price moving between 0-24.  The tunnel is from price of 0 to 24.  It is moving within that tunnel.  When it moves out of that tunnel, to say to a price of 25, then it is in the next tunnel.  Say Apple is selling at 460, it is over 19 tunnels in the air.  19 * 24 = 456.  These tunnels go up and up.  Gann handles this on page 351 of TTTA.  

TTTA, pg. 351:
"Machines for establishing tunnelS through the air".  

[See graphic in the video.]

These red lines are all 0 Aries points.  In the middle of the red lines is the 0 Libra point.  

This webinar is not meant to be a tutorial on the wheel of 24.  It is far more important than you realize when it comes to understanding price through these cycles.  

Price is a function of time.  Each pivot is going to an exact price point.  

Throughout his works, Gann mentions "proportion".  Another word for this is "ratio".  An angle is a ratio.  If you look back at the charts by Gann on the Solaris sites, you'll see he draws a 1x1, 1x2, etc. angles on the charts.  A lot of the charts are hand-drawn by W.D. Gann.  For example, the May Soybeans (maysoybeans1952-54.pdf).

Gann doesn't have 8 angles from each of these highs and lows.  2 up and 2 down.  Sometimes only 3 in one direction.  So you don't need to draw 8 angles at each high and low.  What I'm showing you here, anyone can do.  You have all the tools you need to begin doing this today and now.  This is something that anyone can do (drawing angles).  This is actually how you start out on price.  We're going to get into this here (in this webinar).


Sometimes price only goes up to the angle line and stops there right on the penny, and sometimes they go through the angles like they're not even there.  You have to be expecting a cycle pivot when you hit the line.  If you're not expecting a cycle pivot, then nothing is going to happen.  If you're not expecting a cycle pivot, then you're going to go through the line.  That's the key, my friend!  


In IBM forecasts, we've been showing the pivots.  Now all you have to do is start tracking the angles and see it pivot on the angles.  That's the power, that's the fusion.  The lines by themselves don't mean anything without the cycles.  


The reason we were talking about the wheel of 24 is because he [BA] was being with ya.  You're going to need to know the wheel of 24 inside and out, later in the journey.  It's going to take a while, but you're going to have to have the cycles.  Study the wheel of 24.  Get to know it intimiately.  Understand how to calculate it on anything, especially in decoding TTTA.  

These angles combined with the IBM forecast in WITS, you can make use of immediately.  How to work with these angles?  Watch when price goes up to 1x1, 1x2, and 1x3, (those are the 3 primary angles to start watching).  


IBM:

We're going to look at 3 consectutive turns.  August 7th, 2012, high was a double-inversion.  There were inversions at the exact same point, in BOTH cycles!  Not only can you forecast inversions, which has been going on in these series, but you can forecast double inversions, if you know what you're doing. 


3 Pivots for IBM: 
-------------------
Low: Sept 4, 2012
Low: 193.25 (we'll call that 193.2)

High: Sept 17, 2012
High: 207.99  (we'll call it 208).

Low: Sept 26, 2012
Low: 203.90


[BA brings up a spreadsheet called "IBMANGLES.xls".]
[rluu: BA posted this spreadsheet into WITS.  I've saved it as 
"/home/rluu/download/trading/wits/audioVideoFiles/BA_Webinars/IBM_AheadOfPrice/supplementalMaterial/IBMANGLES.xls"]


So in this spreadsheet, BA looks at cell A1, which is the current day (or day of the expected turn if you want to plug in that date manually), and looks to see if price is approaching or near any of the prices listed in all the Gann angles from previous major highs and lows.

There is a recording of this that BA did, that a lot of the information is left out, and going to be made available in WITS.  In the public recording posted to WITS will have a lot of information left out.

When there is a match-up, BA draws the angle from the major high or low in the pricechart, to show it hitting.  

You only draw out the 8 angles on a big massive high or low.  

Technically, (with this spreadsheet), it shows days, weeks, and months.  Technically, you should be keeping 3 different charts.  One each for days, weeks, and months.  And you don't mix the Gann angles in the columns of the spreadsheet for different time frames.

The first step to working with price is to start working with these angles.  

When the price of the expected cycle pivot stops at an angle, there is a relationship (porportion) between the original pivot that the line was drawn from and the place where the angle hits the price action.  This is also giving you information besides the price point that it is stopping at... How far is this within the cycle?  What angle is this?  It's those types of questions that are important.  Meaning, there's a another whole level here.  These are measurements... by raising and lowering it at certain angles.  

I don't really think people are understanding that.  There's more here than just drawing crazy lines everywhere and connecting highs and lows.  [rluu: I think BA is saying they are measurements for the LOV.].  What do you do with the information?  Well... you start analyzing it.  If a Gann angle line stops the price action, then there's a relationship between the high/low that the Gann angle started at and the place where the price action stopped at the line.  

He's taking measurements!  The measurements give you feed-back.  It gives you information.  What information is it giving you?  For one, it was a ratio.  

What else out there in Gann world, operates off of ratios?  We've talked a lot about it in WITS.  There's videos on it.  What else out there is in ratios?  
[rluu: Octaves and harmony, and Law of Vibration?].


Gann's book, "45 Years On Wall Street", pg. 30.

"One of the greatest discoveries I ever made was how to figure the percentage of high and low prices on the averages and individual stocks.  The percentages of exterme high and low levels indicate future resistance levels.  

There is a relation between every low price to some future high price, and a percentage of the low price indicates what levels to expect the next high price.  At this price you can sell out long stocks and sell short with a limited risk.

The extreme high price or any minor tops are related to future bottoms or low levels.  The percentage of the high price tells where to expect low prices in the future and give syou resistance levels where you can buy with a limited risk."





There's a lot of LOV in book of Revelations.  A lot of important numbers.

In TTTA, when it comes to price, you gotta know Wheel of 24.  



Everyone angle is giving you information.  Homework assignment: Keep in mind that the angles are ratios, and when price stops on an angle, that means there is a relationship between that time-price and the original time-price point that that angle was drawn from.  


Question: Does the scale of angles matter?  
Answer: In Gann's era, he had them on paper, and used only these ratios (1x1, 1x2, 1x3, etc.).  In Metastock, the Gann angles are not consistent.  THe 1x1 in Metastock is not a true Gann 1x1.  Some traders change the scaling for their charts for the angles... Gann did not.  BA would use the Excel spreadsheet program ("IBMANGLES.xls") (similar to provided by BA or shown in the video).  


Question: Cycle-GannAngle-Wheel24 giving clue to price-planet that is causing the price?
Answer: You can use price to square out with a planet, but in all honesty there's a price matrix that runs throughout the stocks and commodities.  That's an honest answer... for lack of a better word.

Question: Are Jensen's instructions in ACSM good to follow for this technique or stick to Gann's instructions in his courses?  You just mentioned Jensen now with harmonics.
Answer:  Both guys are talking about the same thing.  

Question: Did the opening screen have anything to do with ... [BA didn't speak the rest of the question.]
Answer: Yes.  

Question: When you were talking about "relationship", you are talking about "ratios", correct?
Answer: Yes.


BA mentions the video "Lighthouse" in WITS for showing people how to set things up to look for cycles in stocks and commodities.  Note: The length of the cycle in this video is faked, but the overall methodology is sound.  A combination of those types of cycles makes up a forecast.


Question: Is it hard to convert the St. Marie cycle to days.
Answer: Nope, not at all.  It's quite easy. 

Question: Do we combine helio cycles with geocentric triggers?
Answer: No.


When we leave this webinar, BA is going to put the dry run video of this webinar, with some information left out.  The people that missed the live webinar will not get the full thing.
