##############################################################################

Video is length: 18:36  (18 mins, 36 secs).

This video is the second part of the 'Crazy Train' video.  

This video covers the Dow.  It covers the same cycle in the Dow as was used in the original Crazy Train video.  Covers the time period starting from 1950 to 1970.  The point of this video is to illustrate that the cycle is always there.

HIGH early March 1953 to LOW around the 20th of April 1953
LOW around the 20th of April 1953 to HIGH mid August 1953 [BA says this area doesn't feel right, but that's how it happened.  BA complains about the close-only data that doesn't give as good of a feel of the markets.]
HIGH mid August 1953 to LOW mid November 1953
LOW mid November 1953 to HIGH around the 12ish of March 1954

LOW mid May 1955 to HIGH early September 1955
HIGH early September 1955 to LOW mid December 1955 (sideways movement)  [BA says that what's going on between these two sideways movements where it should normally be going down is that there is a lot of strong upward force coming in from an even bigger cycle that causes this cycle to act like that.  Your smaller cycles can have a tendency to go sideways when this happens.]
LOW mid December 1955 to HIGH mid July 1956
HIGH mid July 1956 to LOW about the 20th of October 1956 [BA says he doesn't like how this one looks either, but that's where it came in.]
LOW about the 20th of October 1956 to HIGH mid September 1957 (sideways movement) [BA says there's something going on there.  That's the matrix of the market.  We won't get into that.]
