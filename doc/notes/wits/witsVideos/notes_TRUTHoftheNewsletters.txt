Talking about the WITS newsletter and the the concordance that came along with it.  Looking at the chart of the S&P 500.  

Charting software BA is using is MetaStock Professional.  

According the newsletter, a turn due on Wednesday could come in 2 days either side, so anytime between Monday and Friday.  The concordance is the tool that gives the indication, to narrow down that timeframe; that's it function.  First date in the Newsletter is Feb 23, 2008.  

Dates from the Newsletter:
Feb 22, 2008, Mars gave indication.  [Nailed it, Low.]
Next date in the newsletter was March 6, 2008.  No indication. 
March 8, 2008, 
March 10, 2008, Venus gave indication.  [Nailed it.  Low.]
March 17, 2008, Sun gave indication.  [Nailed it. Low.]
March 21, 2008, March 22nd, Venus gave indication.  [Weekend involved.  High.]
March 27, 2008, No indication.  
April 3, 2008, Venus gave indication.  April 2 was the actual high.  1 day off.
April 6, 2008, April 5, Mars gave indication.  [Weekend involved.  High.]
April 16, 2008, April 15, Venus gave indication.  [Low.]
April 18, 2008, April 17, Sun gave indication.  It was April 18th, it was one day off.  [High].
April 26, 2008, April 28th, Venus gave indication.  [Nailed it High.]
May 2, 2008, May 2, Sun gave indication.  [Nailed it High]
May 5, 2008, May 4 gave indication on a different hit.  Again over the weekend.  
May 15-17, 2008, May 18, Sun gave indication.  Actual date May 19, one day off.
May 24, 2008, May 22, Venus gave indication.  Labeled as a failed turn.  Friday the 23rd was the actual turn.  

If the signal is over the weekend, watch how the price action acts on Monday.  

The WITS newsletter is meant as a stepping stone.  It's free to you if you're in WITS.  These pivots high or low are knowable in advance.  If you get a turn over the weekend, its' better not to hold your options over the weekend.  You need to go back and backtest to see what works better (it's a trader preference).  

How can I determine if these are highs or lows?  These are knowable in advance.  

Think: What are the dynamics I need to understand.  This is a good start.

WITS good vibrations newsletter.  When we first came out with it, people said you couldn't use it to trade.  Because according the newsletter, the turn could be two days on either side.  The newsletter is not meant for something for you trade.  It stems from the lack from understanding of how to use it.  The concordance that was uploaded prior to the newsletter gives indication.  The concordance is the tool to narrow down the turn.  The reason why we waited so long to do this is so we have about 3 months now to be able to see the data.  Now we have March April and May that we have that we can look back on.  

Toyota Motors, a US stock.  Symbol: TM.  

Dates in newsletter:
Feb. 26, 2008.  Feb 24, Venus gave indication.  24th was over the weekend.  [Low].
March 4 or 5, 2008.  No indication.  
March 13, 2008.  March 14, indication from the Sun.  15th and 16th was weekend.  Turn was either on the 14th or over the weekend.  [Low].
March 22, 2008.  Venus, Mercury indication on March 20.  Next date after March 20 is the 24th.  BA believes something happened here, but we'll mark it as failed.  
March 30, 2008, We had multiple indications, which rules that out.  
April 8, 2008, Mercury indication on April 7.  There's a weekend in there.  Marked as failed.  
April 15, 2008, Multiple indications.
April 21, 2008, Mercury gave indication on April 21.  Nailed it High.
April 26, 2008, Venus gave indication on April 25. April 24 was the low.  One day off.  
May 1, 2008.  Mercury gave indication on April 29.  One day off.
May 9, 2008.  Venus gave indication on May 7.  Nailed it high.
May 14, 2008.  Sun gave indication on May 14th.  Nailed it low. 
May 20, 2008.  Venus gave indication on May 19th.  Nailed it high.
May 27, 2008.  Multiple indications.  


Let's look at areas where there are multiple indications.  What 'multiple indications' means is that within that 2 day window there were several factors in there.   So you don't know how at this point how to play it.  Remember, this is a good imbarkation point.  This is the not the end of your analysis.  

There's a way to know we would be expecting a high on this date (4/21/2008).  That wasn't in the newsletter, but there's a way to know that.  The purpose of hte newsletter is not to give that.  The purpose of the newsletter is a springboard to nail down those turn.  This is just a stepping stone.  What you need to start working with is these weekends.  If I had the WITS newsletter and was trading toyota motors, and if it gave indication over the weekend, I wouldn't want to be trading and holding puts over a weekend that gives indication.  

What's important and that I want you to understand is these weekends.  You'll see it time and time again.  This is what weekend turns look like.  [See 10:30ish in the video.]  They can fool ya.  Monday may deceptively look like the low, but price doesn't stop when the market is closed... it just appears to.  So price could have been way below (for a low) during the weekend.  

The cause of the sideways motion is the same between a longer sideways movement for a month, and a shorter one for a few days.  It's just on a different scale.  [rluu: Caused by different planets?].
