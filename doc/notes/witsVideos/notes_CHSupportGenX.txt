This video covers an area that BA feels Craig didn't spend enough time on.  It covers cycle of a larger nature than covered in Cycle Hunter.  This video draws in cycles in US Steel (Symbol NYSE:X).

Use the method in 12 in the section on the 'Bowery Bows'.  Mercury doesn't cause these types of highs and lows, you have to use the outers.

This video covers drawing in cycles in Kohls.  Cycle Hunter didn't grasp these larger cycles, but the same concepts are used as in the smaller cycles.  

Sometimes we don't catch the exact low pivot, because there are other cycles.  No cycle exists by itself.

Cycle parameters is about 3 days off.  Watch the sideways action and then the strong directional move that happens after more than one cycle pivots to move in the same direction.

Sometimes there is a small amount of time between pivots, but BA says there is a reason why.  Also, there was a long move for the cycle.. there's a cause for that, and once that's knowable, you can use that as a powerful tool.

National Australian Bank (NAB).

In Craig's book the Cycle Hunters.  He didn't cover these types of cycles adequately.  So BA is going to go through the longer-range cycles for NAB.  

Pay attention to changes in price activity.  If the trend was strongly going up, then it starts to go sideways, then that is a change.  So a cycle pivoted at that point before the sideways motion. 

Sometimes with an inversion, you'll get a big big move.  There's a factor involved there, and you have to isolate that factor to be able to know when that happens.

Stock TEX (rluu: Swedish stock?).

This video looks at long term cycles on this stock.  Around early year 2000, low, then one day pop, and then it continues downward to a low again because of an inversion.  

A cycle always pivots.  This is something that a lot of people ask.  Does a cycle ever disappear?  No, it doesn't.  It's always there.  I've ran the cycles in wheat 1890s, and the same cycles in wheat today were operative back then.  The cycle doesn't disappear, but what's happening is no cycle ever exists by itself.  So that's what is going when there is some chop.  

This is a classic big-move inversion (early 2000).  Sometimes inversions won't be this bad.  Sometimes an inversion will actually kinda go sideways.  Well there's a factor in there, there's a cause for that.  And it's through understanding these cycles that you realize what is going on.  With those kinds of (big move) inversions, you have to have other factors there also.  

Look at the line connecting the pivots and how the price bounces off the line.  That can be a hint.  Look at how prices 'rides' or reacts to the line.  

There is a reason why a certain pivot is so long.  But we won't get into that.  

Looking at the inversion, in no case, do we have a double inversion.  In all the work that BA has done, he has never drawn a double inversion.  Because he hasn't found one.  There's a good reason.  

Swedish stock SSABA.  We're going to work with a smaller cycle that is a lot faster moving.  We can use day counts on this one.  This one averages 6 days to 10 days.  


Go back and take a look, and find the larger cycle in this, in addition to the smaller cycles.  Find them all actually, and see how they all interact together.  

'Weekend interference' means that a weekend could block it from going to a higher high, or a lower low.  

For cycle hunting, uptrend and downtrends a lot tricker for the novice.  You really got to get a handle on the sideways market and move on from there.  

Congestion areas (chop) are caused by mixed cycles.  

When we can't be sure, we go and look at the next pivot and see that and see how the price activity acts.  BA knew there was an inversion in there somewhere, because it didn't look right.  You can go up (in price) to a low, but you have to be careful about that.  It will trip novices up.  Be extremely careful with applying that.  


You want to know where the cycles are in your stocks and commodities.  Cycle Hunter was written a certain.  You want to understand all the cycles in your stock or commodity.  You don't just want to use only one cycle.  The system in Cycle Hunter was just one cycle, he was just beginning to trade.  He slowly improves that system.  It is a progression to becoming more advanced with your cycle hunting.  That's why you want to know how cycles interact with each other.  It's the combination of other cycles.
