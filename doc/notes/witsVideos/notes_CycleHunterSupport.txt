This is actually the first support video for Cycle Hunter.  
Cycle Hunter is basically a take-off on 12, it's the application of the work in 12.  

Craig can be contacted at bttlc@msn.com, if you have any questions about the content or working through the examples in the book.  


This video talks about weekends and holidays.  A lot of people, when they are hunting a cycle, they don't understand the concept of how a weekend plays into it exactly.  

Stock covered in this video is: Conoco Phillips (Symbol: COP).  

It's important to know exactly where these turns on the weekends are.  When a turn is due on a Saturday or a Sunday, or sometimes even on a Monday depending on the conditions, I will exit the trade on Friday.  We'll look at some reasons why I do that.  

Looking at two consecutive bars: 9/30/2005 and 10/03/2005.  We are missing two bars over the weekend.  The trend changed over the weekend.  

Another example: 
Expecting a turn on 10/23/2005.  

Consecutive bars: 10/21/2005, 10/24/2005, Weekend between those two dates.  Change of trend happened over the weekend.  


We have to be cognicent of weekends.  We have to deal with them.  We have to know that there's curtain there that the cycle can hide behind.  But the cycle is still there.  The cycle does not disappear.  In trading, I'd exit before the weekend.  

We're going down into 11/18/2005, and we expect a turn on 11/19/2005.  There are no bars on 11/19/2005, or 11/20/2005, and the next bar is the 11/21/2005, when price started to move up.  The next expected turn is 11/19/2005, which is over the weekend.  


This turn is tricky here.  11/23/2005 has a bar, 11/25/2005 has a bar, 11/28/2005 has a bar.  We're missing 3 calendars days there.  Thursday is Thanksgiving, Friday the market is only open half a day [in the US], and then the weekend is after that.  So for 4 days, we only have half a day's move... just a few hours.  In an occurance where for the move where price does not have a lot of force behind it, i.e. a slower price move, in this situation where you only have a few hours that it is open, price is going to basically go sideways.  The reason is because the few hours that it is open doesn't have the momentum to take it up or down, so you're going to miss your [destination] price point.  BA recommends never trades that weekend.  He's placed after the weekend, but not before that weekend.  

This concept of the weekends being considered is extremely important to the cycle trader, because the turn can happen over the weekend and we initially won't know which day it is when cycle hunting.

This video deals with proper identification of highs and lows.  
Video looks at US Steel stock (Symbol X).

A stock or commodity has a limited number of cycles in it.  It is not just one.  Ten cycles in a stock is a little bit too high according to BA.  

Double-tops and double-bottoms caused by two cycles making tops together or two ycles makes bottoms together.  This throws so many cycle hunters off when they are looking for cycles.  

Each cycle has it's own specific set of parameters.  This means it has it's own set of mechanics.  And you have to use those mechanics to determine exactly where your cycle is.  There's patterns and you have to know those patterns.  


When a market goes sideways, and then goes down, well, something happened to cause it to change to go down.  That something is a cycle pivot.

This video talks about identification of smaller cycles within the larger cycles.  The larger cycles create long term trends, lasting months.  

Stock the video looks at is US Steel (Symbol X).


What happens is sometimes traders will lose the smaller cycle within the larger cycle.  One of the techniques that I use is called "Detrending".  What that does is it makes the smaller cycles stand out more.  What I have noticed through all the detrending is that I've done, is that patterns repeat.  There's a movie out there called Armageddon (with Bruce Willis in it).  What they do in that movie is they slingshot the spaceship around the Moon.  Price works very similar to that when it comes up on a point of force... the point of force would be a pivot (the point of force pivot would be the moon), and price slingshots around it.  

What I've noticed is the phenomenon that I call the 1 day counter-move.  I believe this cycle going down hit a point of force (a pivot) [March 10, 1997], it bounced up, and then it resumed downwards.  I believe that that was our cycle pivot (March 10, 1997) within the larger cycle.  Something happened with that 1 day jump up, and that was a smaller cycle pivot low date.  That's how you can identify it in there.  

When you get a trend lasting lasting several days to several months, and then it changes, for example going from downwards to sideways.  Then it changes and it goes from sideways to up.  When it changes, that is caused by cycle pivots.  What you want to do is isolate those out of there.  One of hte best ways to do that is learning the techniques used to isolate those.  One of the techniques I've found is the 1-day pivot.  

For moves up, pay attention to the rate if climb being different.  This one day pivot I believe is caused by price going around a point of force.  The 1-day pivot helps identify where the cycle is.  

The trend should encompass the price action.  [rluu: It's like the price action squirrels around the trendline or it bounces off of the trendline.]  

The fast moves that only last a couple of days is caused by two different cycles lining up and pointing in one dirction.  For example: the first cycle needs to make it's high at a certain price while the other is pointing downward and needs to make it's low at a certain price.  When the first cycle hits it's high, the price movement begins to spike down so that it can reach the destination low price connected to the second cycle.

Stock we are looking at in this video is National Australian Bank (NAB).  Video starts looking at the price action mid April to May 1992.  BA is eyeballing this and teaching about cycle mechanics and about cycle pivots.  


One of the questions is "How do you know where the cycle pivots if it is not always an extreme high or low?"  One of the things that you do there is you look at the trend; a momentum directional change occurs at a pivot.  

Early May 1992 area, to May 11, 1992, he calls a "shelf".  We'll going to talk more about shelves.  You can play these shelves in the bigger cycle uptrend.  

In an uptrend, there's a limited number of cycles that cause those shelves.  You need to know the location and the direction of those cycles.  

The 'shelf' is very revealing because it shows that two cycles are going in opposite directions.  It's like a rowboat rowing up a river.  The main current is going on direction and the rowboat is going up the river.  When the two cycles are both aligned, i.e. the smaller cycle aligned with with the bigger main trend, the price will really rocket in one direction.

Stock we are looking at in this video is National Australian Bank (NAB).  This videos are pretty much live.  In the previous video we found about a 4-6 trading day cycle.  In this video we explore this cycle further, even though BA doesn't know what the details to the cause of this cycle is.  

BA is drawing in the cycle in, he is able to do that because he is a cycle master.  It is so important to reach the level of a cycle master.  What that is is someone who's done a lot of cycles.  Once you get to that point, you start noticing these kinds of things (being able to identify cycles, just by eye-balling it).  

Where it gets really good is when you go back in these, and you find the cause, and then you're able to isolate that and take it forward [in time].  Without that, you have no real predictable trading.  

Sometimes there'll be a slowly moving upward price congestion area, you might think that you lost your cycle.  But your cycle is still in there.  To find the small cycle in that area is a problem that BA had when he was first learning how to cycle hunt.  Experience will help you to be able to work through these time periods, and what to look for, and what is occuring.

This video looks at the S&P, from July 18, 2006 to February 21, 2007.


Change in speed of uptrend (trend slope) hints that there was a bigger cycle change.  

The "DP series" is the detrending series that BA wrote in 1999.  It's in WITS now.  Basically the technique is this.  You take the low in the area that you want to detrend, and then the high.  We'll detrend this area, from July 18, 2006 to February 21, 2007.  What detrending does is it makes the incline in price flat, so you can see the smaller cycles better.  

Jul 18, 2006   Low  price is about: 1,225
Feb 21, 2007   High price is about: 1,460

What we want to do is calculate the number of days between these two points.  To do that we go to MS Excel, enter the two dates in two separate cells, and then in a 3rd box, calculate the difference using formula "=f10-f11" and change the cell format to Number to see how many days elapsed between the two dates.  Now we find the price difference.  

In 220 days, we went up 235 points.  

Our formula is: price / time.  We get a value of 1.068.  So for each day, we subtract out 1.068 in price per day elapsed for each of the OHLC for each day.  

Then we chart the finished product (data series).  The resulting chart is easier to look at to determine the cycles.  This can work for any time frame.  

BA believes super_romeman posted the DP series into WITS.

Things going against you is these fast trends.  Detrending helps against that.  Also, remember no cycle exists alone.  They always have company.  Always.  So you have to be aware of those dynamics.  That's something to be aware of too.  You also want to be continuous.  You don't want the big holes in the data where you don't know what was going on.  In the beginning you might have that, but later on you can't have that.  This is because there are some things that are very important for you to do, and they require that you understand all the pivots.  

Detrending is very helpful for the beginner.  Later on, you may not need to detrend anymore because you know from experience how to see the smaller cycles.  

DP series is free to you, it's in WITS.

Video CycleHunterSupportC6.avi.  Video length is 14:01.

Video is looking at May Coffee, time frame around December 2003 to May 2004.  

Some people believe coffee is hard to trade.  Coffee has a lot of smaller cycles in it.  That's what creates these choppy periods.  

In Australia, BA says he has seen a stock that baffled him... he didn't think there were any cycles in it.  He's never seen anything like that, it just drifted.

But generally speaking, there'll be just a few smaller cycles, a few larger cycles, and a medium cycle.  For trading, you could be aware of the medium cycle, and be aware of the smaller cycles.  

BA says price activity from late Jan 2004 to Feb 2004 is normal for coffee.  BA walks through the cycle highs and lows in the video around 1:40.  What is going on in coffee is you have an extra cycle or two that you don't normally have in a lot of the stocks we've been looking at.  Like BA said, one of the ways to filter that out is a medium cycle.  

You might look at that and think there's cycles everywhere, everything's going crazy.  But that's not necessarily the case.  You have to look at that and you have to figure out what cycles are stronger and which cycles are better for you as a trader, and how you want to play it.  It's like fishing, you have to know the [nature of the] fish.  The way to do that is back-testing, to test your system/plan.  Each stock and commodity is different, each has a dynamic that is different.  You have to make it work the way that is profitable to you.  You have to get in there and work with these cycles to find something that works for you.  


Looking at May Coffee December 1999 to Feb 2000.  You might think how do I get a cycle out of that?  One of the techniques is detrending.  It takes a lot of practice.  For something like coffee that's got a lot of small cycles in it, it's hard to see through all the chop that is created.  But the cycles are there.  You would want to at least implement a medium term cycle.  

Well, if it's better not to trade the chop, what do you do?  You need to find the causes and understand why the fast moves happen.  

There are some crazy moves like July 2000 [It is a big spike up for about 2 weeks and a big spike down for about 2 week].  BA says this kind of move generally won't happen in stocks, but you'll see it in commodities.  It happens again in September in 2003.  There's a definite cause for this kind of action, and you can isolate it.  It's knowable in advance.  I won't give it to you, you need find it yourself.  It's quite a revelation when you find it.  

In the period of late 2006, this is basically a sideways market.  BA believes stocks are easier to start out with for the beginner.  Craig did that in his Cycle Hunter.  Commodities operate different than stocks, but the technique is the same.  You can build strength in stocks and then work your way over to commodities.  The principles are the same, but the commodities work under different dynamics.  

In commodities you can work with the continuous contracts.  You might see the big gaps in price between the (year) contract switches [Gann style continuous].  So be aware of that.  As Gann said, each contract had it's own personality.  The reason to watch out is because when you connect highs and lows across a contract switch, your low might be less intuitive to spot because you have to compensate.
