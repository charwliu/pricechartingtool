Bible quotes from the Introduction:

"{2:16} And the LORD God commanded the man, saying, Of every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat: {2:17} But of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it: for in the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die." Genesis 2:16-17

"{3:2} And the woman said unto the serpent, We may eat of the fruit of the trees of the garden: {3:3} But of the fruit of the tree which [is] in the midst of the garden, God hath said, Ye shall not eat of it, neither shall ye touch it, lest ye die. " Genesis 3:2-3

"{1:3} And he shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of water, that bringeth forth his fruit in his season; his leaf also shall not wither; and whatsoever he doeth shall prosper." David in Psalms 1:3

"{22:2} In the midst of the street of it, and on either side of the river, [was there] the tree of life, which bare twelve [manner] of fruits, [and] yielded her fruit every month: and the leaves of the tree [were] for the healing of the nations. " John in Revelation 22:2


pg. 7
Blood is the basic material of which the human body is continually builded.  
rluu: Dwight Munson says that our blood is a secondary form of the Earth energy.

As is th blood, so is the body;
as is the body, so is the brain;
as is the brain, so is the quality of thought.
As a man is builded, so thinks he.

pg. 8
The Bible (both the Old and New Testaments) are symbolic writings, based primarily upon the process of body building.  

"Alchemy" really means fleshology.  it is derived from the word "Chem", an ancient Egyptian word meaning flesh.  The word "Egypt" also means flesh, or anatomy.

Alchemy, in a broader sense means the science of solar rays.  

pg. 9
The word "Gold" means solar essence, or solar rays (according to Hebrew cosmology and the Kabala).  Alchemists always referred to solar rays when they used the word "gold".

The transmutation of gold means the process of changing solar rays into all manner of materialized forms, vegetable, mineral, etc.  It is summed up as the changing of spirit into matter.

"Base metals" simply means matter or basic.

According to the Kabala, "M" and "E" figure "B", when united.  
Our English "B" is from the Hebrew Beth, meaning a house or temple (the temple of the soul, or the body).  

The body is really the "Father's House", or the temple of God.

Solomon's temple is an allegory of man's temple -- the human organism.  

pg. 10
The solar (soular) plexus is the great central Sun or dynamo on which the Subconscious Mind (another name for God) operates and causes the concept of individual consciousness.  The brain of man is the "Son of God", the mediator (medium) between the central dynamo and the Cosmic Ocean of Space.  

The Holy Trinity:
God = the solar plexus
The Son = the brain
Holy (whole) Spirit = air (aerial elements, such as blood, inbreathing the breath of life, etc.).

"Your bodies are the temple of the living God"
"The Kingdom of Heaven is within you."

"Elixir of Life"

pg. 11
The nerves are all connected with the brain differently, or by the spinal marrow, but the nerves receive their sustenance from the blood, and their motive power from the solar plexus dynamo.

pg. 12
There is not known in all the realms of architecture or mechanics one little device which is not found in the human organism.  The pulley, the lever, the inclined plane, the hinge, the "universal joint," tubes and trap-doors; the scissors, grind-stone, whip, arch, girders, filters, valves, bellows, pump, camera, and Aeolian harp; and irrigation plant, telegraph and telephone systems -- all these and a hundred other devices which man thinks he has invented, but which have only been telegraphed to the brain from the Solar Plexus (cosmic centre) and crudely copied or manifested on the objective canvas.

pg. 13
Air, or Spirit, breathed into the lungs, enters the arteries (air carriers) and chemically unites with the mineral base, and by a wonderful transformation creates flesh, bone, hair, nails, and all the fluids of the body.

On the rock (Peter or Petra, meaning stone) of the mineral salts is the human structure built.  The minerals in the body do not disintegrate or rot in the grave.

Blood is made from air; thus all nations that dwell on earth are of one blood, for all breathe one air.

pg. 14
"word made flesh"
"breath of life."

"{2:7} And the LORD God formed man [of] the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul." Genesis 2:7

pg. 15
Grief depresses the circulation though the vagus.  The vagus nerve is so named because of its wandering (vagrant) branches.  The roots of the vagus nerve are in the medulla oblongata, at the base of the small brain or cerebelum.  The vagus nerve conducts the mental state to the heart and thus controls the heart action.

The nerves of the human body constitute the "Tree of Life" with its leaves of healing.  The flowing waters of the Rivers of Life are the veins and arteries which sweep the red, magnetic currents of Love -- of Spirit made visible.

pg. 16
The divine telegraph system is the nerve wires.
The Central Sun of the human system is the Solar Plexus -- vibrating life abundantly.

Around this dyanmo of God (the Solar Plexus), you may see the beasts that worship before the throne day and night.  The "Beasts" are the twelve plexuses of nerve centers, telegraph stations, like unto the twelve zodiac signs that join hands in a fraternal circle across the gul of space.

pg. 17
We wonder and adore in the presence of that pulsing orb, th heart.  Tons of the water of life made red by the Chemistry of Love sweep through this central throne every day, and flow on to enrich the Edenic Garden until its waste places shall bloom and blossom as the rose.

pg. 18
The true church of God is the human body.  In this body, or church, spirit operates like some wizard chemist or electrician.

"Day of Judgement": Judgement means understanding, hence the ability to judge.  Man then judges correctly for he sees the Wisdom of Infinite Life in all men, in all things, all events, and all environments.  

pg. 19
When he (man) finds out what he really is, and how much he has always had to do in the making of himself what he is, he will be ready to grasp some idea of the wonderful possibilities of every human soul and body, and will know how completely and entirely is every man his own savior.

Our bodies are completely made over every year, by the throwing off of worn-out cells and the formation of new ones.  Nature will take care of the making-over process, but we are responsible for the plan of reconstruction.  

pg. 24
The Pyramids are encyclopeic of physical science and astral lore.  The science of numbers, weights, measures, geometry, astronomy, astrology, and all the deeper mysteries of the human body and soul are embodied in these incomparable monuments.

pg. 25-26
And when Man is once fully alive to his own heritage, realizing the wonders and possibilities of his own body, and to provide for its needs, eh will assert the divine right within him to be an Ego, a soul, in command of its own templ, and the environments of that temple, adn will rejoice in the revaled truth of his own divinity that alone can make him free.
