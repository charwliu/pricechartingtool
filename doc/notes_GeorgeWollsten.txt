Page 21 has the first general year dates in the book.

Page 30 has the first actual date in the book: May 25, 1908.  From this date, we can work backwards to the beginning, and forwards.

Page 86: Bible story of Jacob and his brothers, in the the story of Jacob while working for Laban.  Story of 7 lean cows and the seven ugly ones related to market movements that last 7 years.  Regular season of the year does not show repeat movements, but certain number of "caterpillars" could possibly grow in seven years.  Two and one-half caterpillars might grow one way, and two and one-half the other during seven years.  Story in the Apocalypse about the woman in "time and times and half a time" equals 3.5 times and twice that is 7.

pg. 101: Not sure what this is about, but picking up aspects?  (distances between planets)?  Look at when Mercury conjoins a planet heliocentrically and then look at locations of other planets at that time?  "Let them be born on that day."

pg. 106, 107: These pages are explaining an important rule.  I need to go back and try again to decode these pages.  Bayer is trying to tell us what "thee" means in the Bible too.

pg. 112: Another rule, I haven't translate.

Illustrations:

Chart for Daily Wheat from 1909 to 1911 was not included in the PDF version of this book, but is included in the hardcopy.  Is it worth trying to get this?


Synopsis:

While the story itself is interesting, the main subject “how to trade and avoid all the pitfalls of the Pit and of Wall Street” is developed slowly without complicated explanations. Everything is worked up naturally, just like a normal person would go about to take a walk up to a mountain – to success in Wall Street and in the Pit.


Characters:

Jim Wollsten - Farmer that immigrated from Europe.

George Wollsten - Immigrated from Europe, helps Jim on the farm but gradually shifts into trading wheat.  He learns how to "square the circle".

rluu: Wollsten sounds like "Rolls-Ten" (rolls of ten?).

Grete - Wife of Jim Wollsten

Gusty - Wife of George Wollsten

Mr. Schafer - Prosperous farmer of Upper Red Hook.  

Sepp Muller - (=Moon) In the story, he thinks he knows the market.  rluu: Sounds like "Sap Puller", i.e. the moon.

Julius Holten - Man that helps Jim get set up on a farm.  
rluu: "Holten" sounds like "Whole Ten" or "Hold Ten" or "Hole ten".

Apple orchards, whose fruit represented the main income of the community, were barren and desolate.  (rluu: Leo is a barren sign?)

Keyword: Barn (rluu: a storage of aspects?  a storage of planets?)

"Paula and Robert, the couple that helped at Wollsten’s, were up already. So was Jim Wollsten, because lights in the two houses betrayed them. Jim and Robert were already in the barn, airing it to avoid overheating. Last Fall they had stored the best of their apple crop in it to hold for better market prices."

(pg. 102, "That was the day the last box of apples was moved out of the barn." "The barn simply would have to have several windows in a hurry so that some light would penetrate, making these windows in a way to enable them to shut tightly during the winter in order to store the next apple crop.")
