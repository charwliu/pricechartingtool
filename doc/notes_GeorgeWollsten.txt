Illustrations:

Chart for Daily Wheat from 1909 to 1911 was not included in the PDF version of this book, but is included in the hardcopy.  Is it worth trying to get this?


Synopsis:

While the story itself is interesting, the main subject “how to trade and avoid all the pitfalls of the Pit and of Wall Street” is developed slowly without complicated explanations. Everything is worked up naturally, just like a normal person would go about to take a walk up to a mountain – to success in Wall Street and in the Pit.


Characters:

Jim Wollsten - Farmer that immigrated from Europe.

George Wollsten - Immigrated from Europe, helps Jim on the farm but gradually shifts into trading wheat.  He learns how to "square the circle".

rluu: Wollsten sounds like "Rolls-Ten" (rolls of ten?).

Grete - Wife of Jim Wollsten

Gusty - Wife of George Wollsten

Mr. Schafer - Prosperous farmer of Upper Red Hook.  

Sepp Muller - (=Moon) In the story, he thinks he knows the market.  rluu: Sounds like "Sap Puller", i.e. the moon.

Julius Holten - Man that helps Jim get set up on a farm.  
rluu: "Holten" sounds like "Whole Ten" or "Hold Ten" or "Hole ten".

"Paula and Robert, the couple that helped at Wollsten’s, were up already. So was Jim Wollsten, because lights in the two houses betrayed them.
