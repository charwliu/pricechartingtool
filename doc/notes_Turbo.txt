CD says this Turbo was recorded Jan 2006.

About WITS:
Place to share unbiased research without the negative elements of other sites.
Other sites were overrun by vendors and marketers.

WITS does not have vendors, per se.  Generally will not have vendors.

Many successful members have come out of WITS.  You can see these people coming through the site, as they grow.  

BA is talking about important members.

Haytham started posting around June 2001.  Study his posts.  Pull out all his posts and put it in a file.
H.Albizem@worldnet.att.net
gann_trader_19

Allan Blakstad.
Study his posts.  Post 13476 talks about how Gann used the squares.  Covers the coffee letter.  Go through Alblak's posts and create a study file.

Lorin Baker.
He posts his market calls, techniques, etc.  Uses geometry.

W.D. Gann also predicted worldly events.  Posts 11473, 12493, both start series on mundane predictions.


Reloaded series: Nov 30, 2003, Post 12659.

Quarters series: Post 12661.

About TAC, who started with families and not knowing anything.  13 months later, they started making accurate market calls.  Post 15179.  

WITS uses the Solaris site as a backup site.  This was needed because Yahoo stopped supporting the archiving of attachments.  It is a manual process to do the archiving.

In the WITS library: Ancient books, rare documents.  

BA has been in the (trading) field since around 1996.

Start out with:
1) Gann's master stock course and Gann's master commodity course.  
These works shows the application of his system.  But you need to study TTTA to get the system.

2) TTTA
Gann's system is in this book.

3) The Power of Numbers by Numero.  
He shows a simple technique of how you can work with numbers to achieve results.  It's just the first step.

4) Kabala of Numbers by Sepharial.  Then read anything by Sepharial.
Sepharial was the most represented author on the Gann reading list.


The coffee letter shows that Gann definitely used astrology.  TTTA
shows that Gann used astrology also.  All the people who have been able to make some market calls in WITS use astrology.  


The Squares run off of cycles.  These cycles are found in TTTA.  Until you understand the cycles, you're not going to get the squares working.  How do you what cycle number to anchor it to?  You don't.  You have to get the cycles working first.  

Ruth Miller has a book out.  She is a WITS member.  rmiller@otecom.net  (BA said that may not be the exact email, but it is close) She has the actual method that W.D. Gann used.  It's in "The Corn Method".  Gann used the Sq. of 9 in the same method that she talks about in that book.  The Sq. of 9 is a calculator.  

You'll see factors repeated in the Stock, Commodity courses and TTTA.  

Keep in mind, you don't necessarily need Gann to make money in the markets.

After reading the books mentioned above, decide where you want to take your research.  You can email people on WITS.  Get out there and interact and meet people like you who want to succeeed.  

WITS has seminars.  They try to make it very affordable.  You want to meet people and work together with people at these.  

The WITS library is for the serious researcher.  It's going to take time, but it's well worth it.  Many people have 9-5 jobs, families, etc.  If you are really serious, WITS is a fantastic forum.  

Post 24730, by super_romeman.  Oct. 11, 2005.  Exerpts from Gann's book about Max Pete.  

"I was able to catch its moves up and down over 90 per cent of the time just the same as if I had been making the fluctuations myself. Many other stocks work just as well as this for me, while others do not favor me and I have never made any money out of them. It makes no difference whether you know or do not know the reason why a thing works or does not work; just as soon as experience teaches you that there is something that works against you, the only thing to do is to quit."  
W. D. Gann, Truth of the Stock Tape, p. 75


BA says he knows people that can make money without Gann.  Some of these people don't even have a system.  One thing about all these people is that they found a stock they can consistently make money in.  

One thing to try is to paper trade it first.  Stay away from stocks that are bad to you.  Stick with the stocks that are good to you.  

If you are after a system, you have to find a system that works for you.  

The way to approach people (to write a private email to the person), make sure you have some knowledge.  Come on like you actually have done some homework, like you have tried to find the answer yourself.  

Books that WITS is trying to get ahold of: Those by Jensen and Sepharial.  

Sometimes WITS members will be unwilling to fully elaborate on a topic.  Some people have spent years on this, and they might feel you need to put some time into it.  You might get a flakey answer.  Be aware that this might happen.  It might take some time to gain respect, and then they can see eye to eye with you.

In their formative years, the communication might have been hard.  Back then, it was over paper mail.  

WITS will tell you what to study, and what not to study.

There's different areas of Gann:
Astrology 
Numerology
Mild Geometry.

Good primer and beginning astro book:
Jensen's Astro Cycles and Speculative Markets.

Good advanced book:
"12"

BA says "12" costs 480 dollars (in 2006).  rluu: I'm not sure how much it costs now.  

They used to sell the book "6", now they sell "12".  It is created by many WITS members.

Discoveries definitely make it all worthwhile.  There's different levels in this field.  We all have to go through out own paths.  There's nothing more exciting than making a discovery.  

When you realize how something works, it generally is a shock.  There's a mental relief that you experience.  It's the "ah ha!".  

The financial markets work off of natural laws.  These laws are totally understandable.  It's like gravity.  The natural law is always in effect. 

Gann, Bayer, Jensen, did not believe markets are random.  Markets work by natural laws, and these laws can be understood.  These laws are always operable in financial markets.  Discovering even some of these natural laws will lead to profit.  

George Bayer used Gann's systems.  We have his material in the WITS library.

Many people have been able to replicate Gann.  There's people alive who can trade better than Gann.  This is due to better knowledge and better equiptment (computers) to avoid human errors.

Gann's primary astrologers (both employed by Gann):
Lurther Jensen - Under the guise of the Kansas City Bureau of Economic Research
Johndro - "Earth in the Heavens".  "Fixed Stars".  Both his books are in the WITS library.

Gann died in 1955.  He lived in an era where astrology was totally unacceptable.  Today astrology is still not acceptable, but more acceptable than before.  

Gann had a very religious wife.  Gann was not religious (he didn't go to church).  

Gann's own son was made by the mother to turn against Gann himself.  When Gann died, Gann's son and his mother ran to the bank to see what money was left.  THere was only about $100,000 and they were pissed off.  Gann's son then said that all Gann got all his money from selling books.  

W.D. Gann would go to these lotteries in cuba.  At the time, the American mobs controlled the Cuban casino.  Gann would go down there, and due to certain formuas he had, he would break them.  They got sick of him winning and winning.  So they poisoned him.  On his way back on his airplane, he was complaining of chest pains, and he landed in miami, rushed to the hospital where he died.  

There were papers at his house that he left orders to be burned by his lawyer.  The papers did get burned, but there are documents that escaped via a different route.  BA knows where the documents are and who's got them, but he can't disclose that.  So there's still a lot of information out there.

So what happened to the money?  Gann's next door neighbor was an international lawyer who set up a trust in the Bahamas.  The profits from his trading account was cyphoned into the Bahamas bank, where it remains today.  He is reported to have taken 50 million dollars out of the markets.  That's where it is at.  

You don't need complicated astrology.  You don't need Vedic astrology.  BA has never seen Gann use it.  Gann used simple astrology.  A good book for a beginning foundation is Luther Jensen's ACSM.


Traders today can replicate Gann's type of results.  

Everyone in this field has their other path.  The function of the CD is to give paths that you can begin with.  The goal is to trade profitably, consistently.  You can wait till you get Gann's system, or you can trade now.  Then the goal is to acquire a system or to acquire a better system.  There are systems in "12".  There are systems in WITS.  There is plenty of information.  

Stick to stocks that are good to you.  Avoid the ones that are not good to you. 

The real key to Gann is cycles.  You have to understand the cycles.  Without doing that you will never understand Gann's systems.  Your real goal is to get the cycles.  YOU HAVE TO GET THE CYCLES.  There is no other way.  

Gann's audited financial records was read by BA.  Accuracy percentages.

Go to the Solaris site and look at the Gann Coffee Letter, in writings of W.D. Gann.  In that, you will see what Gann is doing.  He had a student sign a non-disclosure, and then Gann died, and he disclosed it.  The coffee letter has astrology in it.  

It is actually a mix between astrology and astronomy.  There are two main systems in an Ephemeris: Geocentric and Heliocentric.  Both of these have validity in cycles.  You can pull cycles out of both systems.  

Free software: Astrolog

When you're ready to get software that does more, you can go get Solar Fire.  But you don't need that.  

Signs of the zodiac is given by BA:
Aries, Taurus, Gemini, Cancer, Leo, Virgo, Libra, Scorpio, Sagittarius, Capricorn, Aquarius.  
Each has 30 degrees.

BA mentions declinations of planets (where the planets are up and down).  It is very important in this field.  Min and max declination of the Sun (at the solstices): 23 degrees 27 minutes.  

Natals.  A natal is simply a snapshot of where the planets are at a given moment of time.  In Gann terms, the snapshot is taken at the beginning of something.  Natals contain sensitive points.  As planets move around the zodiac, it is going to hit these sensitive points, which will cause a market to turn. 

Post 26749: You can take these sensitive points and calculate when a turn will happen.  This post covers application to markets.  

Planet ingress has significance.  

When planets hit their max North or South declination, or 0 declination will cause turns in some markets.  Some stocks and some commodities will turn on these dates for Mars.

Planets move in ellipses.  When they are closest to the Sun, they move the fastest.  When they are further, they move slower.  Planets that are closer to the Sun have smaller periods.  

84 year cycle in the U.S. of revolutions.  

There are:
20 year cycles
4-minute cycles

Perihelion - When planet is closest to the Sun.
Aphelion - When planet is furthest from the Sun.

There are systems that are based on perihelion and aphelion. 

Fixed stars.

North node is a very important point.  18.6 year revolution.  Some trading systems use it, including Gann's.  Always use the True Node.  Gann did not have the True node available.  You need to use the mean node when following him.  He would have used true node if he had it.  

Two planets that you need to be aware of:
Chiron - About 52 year revolution.  Chiron rules Taurus.
Transpluto - Rules Virgo.

These definitely have effects and definitely turn markets.  

Example:
Plug in:
May 24, 1981.
4:46 am 
Central Daylight Time (+5:00)
Chicago, Illinois.

Ascendant: 19 Taurus 49

Critical points of chart:
Ascendant - Very important point.  Used to call turns.
Midheaven - MC


Example:
McDonald's - True natal that the price is vibrating to.
Dec. 12, 1949 (Later in the recording BA says it is 1948.  rluu: Wikipedia gives the date December 12, 1948 as a date when McDonald's was first opened with that name.)
2:18 pm
Pacific standard time (+8:00)
San Bernardino, California

Ascendant: 11 Taurus 57
Midheaven: 26 Capricorn 42


This should be about enough to start calling turns.  It's in how you use this knowledge.  This is a good starting foundation.  

BLH in her lecture uses Moon declination points at max north, max south, and 0 points.  You can make a lot of money off of just this system.  

The Ascendant and MC points have effects.  


Example:
Mars position at 12 Capricorn 15.  
When a certain planet transits that point, you could get a turn if that point is active.  



##############################################################################
Turbo 2.
##############################################################################

Gets into direct market application.  We will see how turns are made, and how these factors and time those turns. 

Turbo 2 is about: Cycles in stocks and commodities.

Master rule: Each stock or commodity responds to its own cycles, which are independent of cycles of other stocks or commodities.  

The job of the market technicians is to find these cycles.

We break them down into the 4 main cycles:
Declination
Longitude
Time cycles
Hits to natals.


Gann had a list for of each stock or commodity that he traded.  The list was comprised of the cycles that that stock or commodity would respond to.  Like venus aspecting mars, new moon, jupiter aspecting saturn, etc.  Each of those are cycles.  Some will respond to a different commodity than others.  What you can do is make a list for whatever stock or commodity you are studying.  


The way to tel is go through past data to see if it has a history of responding to an astrological event.  The way to do this is set up tests. 

The function of this CD is to get into that.  This is what Bayer, Gann and Jensen were doing.  They were all into cycle work.  They would extract these cycles.  If we want to emulate them, this is what we have to do.  


1) Declination cycles.  There are two types:  
   - Based on declination of a single planet.  
   - Based on Two or more planets; their relationship to each other.  

BLH talks about moon hitting 0 south and cotton changing direction about 50% of the time.  This is in the BLH lecture.  This lecture occurs many times a year.  She separates this by rising market versus declining market (e.i. main trend up, versus main trend down).  If trend is up and moon hits 0 south, then cotton changes trend about 80% of the time.  If trend is down and moon hits 0 south, trend changes happen less than 50% of the time.  This is where typical astrologers go wrong.  They don't separate things like this.  We have to make this very important distinction between a rising or falling market.  

Some aspects will have no effect in a rising market, but will have an effect in a falling market.  Or vice versa.  

Each market has to be tested independently.  

The moon going 0 south in a rising cotton market, but will have no effect in wheat or Dow.  

Declination cycle between two or more planets: Parallel and contra-parallel aspects.  

Here in stocks, a good combination to get turns for stocks is usually: Transiting Sun parallel or contra-parallel Mercury.  However cotton or wheat may not respond to that.  Some market technicians eventually find this.  What is missing in the current day curriculum is that large turns occur when outer planets are close to a parallel or contra-parallel, and a fast moving planet, acting as a trigger, such as Mercury, Venus or Mars, makes a parallel or contra-parallel to those two planets that are coming into aspect.  

As an example, Jupiter at +13 deg 55 min of declination, and Saturn at +13 deg 48 min of declination, and a turn occurs when transiting Mercury hits +13 deg 51 min of declination.  Mercury is the trigger.  So that will time your turn.  

Another is transiting Saturn at +13 deg 48 min of declination, transiting Uranus at -13 deg 42 min of declination, turn occurs when Mars hits -13 deg 45 min declination.  Again the contra-parallel is setting up between Saturn and Uranus, and Mars is the trigger.  

You need to find which planets your stock responds to.  You need to go to highs and lows and see which planets affect your market.  If they are, then put it on your list of things affecting your stock or commodity.  

2) Time Cycles:  
Time Cycles uses a Time Factor.  The concept of a Time Factor is important in our field.

All the authors that could make consistent market calls talked about knowledge of the Time Factors. George Bayer wrote a book about it called Time Factors in the Stock Market.  Luther Jensen mentioned Time Factor on page 126 of his book.  Gann mentions Time Factor on page 62 of The Truth of the Stock Tape.  He also mentions it in TTTA on page 197, where he states "Great discovery of a Time Factor with which he figured Major Motors would decline until about June 30, 1927, then start an advance which would last until about September 16, 1927."  So Gann is actually giving us specific dates and saying there is a time factor here.  So if we need further information, we need to search the WITS archives on or about Time Factors.  I'm told these cycles are extremely important.  


3) Another type of cycle type: The Natal
In a natal chart, not all the points of the natal are active.  So it's up to the market technician to determine which point(s) produce price turns, and which do not.  A 15-degree axis is employed.  

Using McDonalds: Asc 11 Taurus 57.  Use this as an anchor to determine the other points on the 15-degree axis (all around the circle).  This gives us 24 points all around the circle.  

WITS Posts at the end of 2005, there are WITS post about this 15-degree axis. 
Do a search for: "15 degree axis" 

If this point (the ascendant) is active, then when a planet hits any of the 15-degree axis points, then we will get turns.  Let's look at a one-year time frame in McDonalds stock: July 1997, to July 1998.  On 7/7/1998, Uranus was at 11 Aquarius 47.  There's a note here, we are using an orb of 10 minutes on either side of exact.  This gives us a 20 minutes swath.  

There's a way to determine in advance exactly when the point will be triggered.  The exact day of a turn can be known in advance.  BA is going to leave it for us to find.  He did a call around early November 2005.  He used a very close moving planet; he used Saturn; and he used the natal.  On 7/30/1997, Chiron was at 26 Libra 56.  Both of these points are on the axis.  They are all on our 11 Taurus 57 axis.  Looking at the turn is very impressive.  Note also 7/7/1998, transiting Mercury is in opposition to transiting Uranus.  Transiting Uranus was on the axis.  It can be readily observed that the ascendant is an active point on the natal of McDonalds.  And there are more active points in that natal.  

The natal will consistently produce turns.  It's an awesome timer.  It's going to take you a while to learn it.  It is worth it because it pays well.  It pays well in money and in freedom.  

George Bayer wrote about natals.  Gann has hand-drawn chart of natals.  Jensen wrote about natals.  Natals are a type of cycle.  They produce turns.  

4) Straight longitudal aspect.  It is an aspect between two planets.  You use the 15-axis.  Every time they (the two planets) are a multiple of 15 degrees apart, you look for turns.  There is a scientific way to test that.  Each stock or commodity responds to it's own planets.  Your goal as a trader is to find which planets dominate your stock or commodity.  What Gann did for this, was he actually had a list of aspects that would affect that particular stock or commodity.  He did this for his long term trading of course, not for his intraday stuff.  For example for Soybeans, he went through and went to see which one of the longitudinal aspects would worked, which one of the lunar aspected workd, which one of the declinations it would respond to.  And he would compile a list of this, and he would use other techniques and other cycles to confirm a turn.  Jensen says to use 6 degrees approaching or pass for an aspect.  We can't do that here.  BA says to use 10 minutes of orb either side.  

A lot of people are taking Jensen's work out of context.  You can't do 6 degree orb.  What Jensen was doing was saying 6 degrees, but that was for something else from what we are doing here.  

For example: For a Jupiter-Uranus 120 degree aspect, we would look the swath (range) of 119 deg 50 min, to 120 deg 10 min.  That's a 20 minute swath, or 10 minutes on either side.  If a turn happened within this time frame, then we would take it as a turn, and if it did not, then it would not count as a turn.  We would take all these aspects over a long period of time.  We would want to do around 40, 50, or 60, per planetary pair.  BA would do about 200 aspects, to get a good set, and then he would take a look at the percentages that would make turns.  


In stocks or commodity, there is a varying of strengths of cycles.  Some will be weak and some will be strong.  You have to comb those cycles out.  Gann would know out of those 4 types of cycles, he would know which ones of them was strongest in a particular stock or commodity, and which would be good for reinforcing.  He would have a list of what was operating in that stock or commodity.  

We want to do the same technique.  A good example that works: Jupiter and Uranus in the Spring for soybeans.  

Out of these 4 cycles, these are the primary cycles.  There are secondary ones that work, like solar arcs and BLH does some stuff on weather.  There are weather cycles, and other types of cycles, which are secondary cycles.  The 4 BA listed are what he calls the primary cycles.  

There's also a main tool that Gann used, which BA hasn't mentioned yet.  It's talked about in WITS Post 4484 through 4486.  It's also a very good starting point for work to do in that particular regard.  The goal is to get the cycles working so you can know when a turn is coming, so you know how to play the market.  

In Paris, alblak1940 said "There is a lot happening at highs and lows."  BA had been saying that for years.  BA says: "There is more than one way to skin the cat."  A lot of these cycles tie into each other.  You get double and triple confirmation at tops and bottom.  There are many cycles that lock into each other.  

Number one thing to do is to get these cycles working in your market.  




About Intraday trading: Gann definitely had an intraday system, which many traders are seeking.  That goal was held out a lot amongst BA's students.  Many traders are interested in intraday timing.  The fundamental problem is that the good traders wrote very little about intraday trading.  The information is not really out there.  

Gann's system is the ultimate in intraday trading.  

BA told this to someone privately about intraday: "Look this is the truth.  You'll going to have to get Gann's stuff working on a larger timeframe.  That's where people have writting the most.  Then you have to take that and take it down to the intraday level.  You can't hit it from moving straight into intraday.  You have to get his swing trading system, and get that down into the intraday format.  Now that's the truth."  It's the correct route.  

The other way to do it is to have someone spoon feed you the answers, and that doesn't happen in this field.  

Gann's intraday system is 100 times better than any other intraday system that BA has actually seen.  The reason for this is because he gets into the actual cause of the markets.  

For his system, you'll be able to see: There'll be a turn here at this time, a low here at this time, a high at this time.  That'll give you a perfect entry and exit point.  

Gann never wrote on his intraday trading.  So go for his swing trading, and bring it down to the intraday format.  Go for where the information is.  

The Gann trader will know what the day looks like before it happens.  Proof of this is in Haytham's WITS post 2926.  You need the attachments for this post.  The attachments are in the 'First two years of WITS' CD.  The intraday turns are shown.  What the post is called: "Exact points, law of vibration."  Many missed the forrest from the trees when he posted that.  The price action looks the same from the year before.  That's something to get you started on.  It's a big clue that Haytham would post something like that.  What Haytham did was take Gann's swing trading, and took it down to intraday.  

"Tunnel lock box" post.  There is a lot of information in WITS.  One of the posts that is one of BA's favorite is 1755.  On Oct. 5, 2001.  By Haytham.  This post has to do with the secrets in TTTA.  

He went back and re-did Gann's forecasts.  He did really good with it.  But he doesn't post anymore.  He kind of faded from posting, and he evolved.  

Some people post things in a matter of fact way.  There is good information. 

If you get stuck and have no more ideas, go back and read these posts.  

Alblak1940.  He is a great poster, great guy.  He's the real deal.  95% of what he says BA agrees with.  He did about 10 years of work on decoding TTTA.  He is very gifted in terms of decoding that book.  Make sure you go through and get all his posts.  

Gann's other books.  BA is always asked which ones to focus on.  Review of them:

Magic Word: The book is written in code.  BA says don't spend too much time on this.  

How to make money in Stocks and Commodities. 
Truth of the Stock Tape.  
Wall Street Stock Selector. 

WITS doesn't have these books due to copyright laws.  Supposely these books are still under copyright.  These books are available from Lambert Gann Publishing.  All these contain market data and a few clues sprinkled about.  For example Time Factors. 

You can succeed without these books.  But you can't succeed without mastering TTTA.  It won't hurt to read these books, but keep your focus on TTTA.  When reading the other books, dog-ear the pages that seems outside the common information, or if it contains anything on cycles.  

Sometimes he talks about a stock did this or that... and then he'll back up and give you a reason.  It's those reasons and subsequent information that you want to pay attention to.  Mark these places.  

Examples of 'outside information':
pg. 75 of Truth of the Stock Tape.  
Chapter. 1 of Wall Street Stock Selector.  (Complete chapter on cycles).

If you get to something about a topic in TTTA, and then you'll want to test it somewhere, you can go back to these books other books of Gann.  And you can go straight to the other books, and flip through the material from Gann's other books.  The main system is in TTTA. 

Another book:
45 Years on Wall Street:
It is written in a way where Gann wants you to work through the data.  Because he is going through all this stuff and you have no idea what he is doing.  You need to first acquire Gann's system in TTTA, before you work on this books.  Why did he use '45 years', when at the end he says his experience was not actually 45 years?  (rluu: Because 45 years is 1/8th of a circle).  

The Master Courses:
Many don't get anything out of them that is consistent.  It is just a collection of some of these courses.  Some courses are in private hands, and some courses are in a vault.  Gann would make some changes to the courses over time, so there are different versions of the same course.  

The actual systems that Gann used is in TTTA.  You can bounce some ideas off of the master courses, but the main information is in TTTA.  A lot of really smart people have tried to find the system in master courses, but they couldn't do it.  They got it throught TTTA.  

Recap:
There are 4 primary cycles.
Our goal is to forecast financial markets in advance.  We need to utilize at least one of those cycles mentioned previously to do this.  

Where we are going to take this series:
There are three authors; they are Gann, Bayer and Jensen.  All three of these authors were equally successful... meaning they knew the same techniques.  They wrote differently, but they knew the same systems.  They had equal knowledge.  You need to find which one of these you can understand better for yourself.  

Assignment:
Get one of those 4 cycles working.  Get a minimum of one working, and you will start to see things working.  That's all you need.  That's the correct approach.

Talking about George Bayer.  The reason he's important is because he knew exactly what Gann did.  He wrote about it too.  Bayer spread his stuff across many books.  We are going to review Bayer's writing and then cross reference them.  

There is many things going on.  There is different ways to skin the cat.  Some find Gann easier and some find Bayer easier.  We are going to go through his writings.  He (Bayer) wrote about different parts of different systems in different books.  

Egg of Columbus:  
The master/major key is found in a footnote in this book.  This book has a self-contained technique.  Gann wrote about this same technique in TTTA.  They are identical.  

Ebooks in wits contain two page numbers.  There are the physical pages (from the physical book) and then the PDF page numbers.  The page numbers that BA will be giving are the ones from the actual physical book.  

Bible Interpretation:
Page 15, Verse 14: Aries is morning or East, Cancer is noon or South, Libra is West or evening, and Capricorn is midnight or North.  'Upon thy belly shalt thou go' is pointing to the abbreviation in the sign Aquarius, wavy lines or jitters.   'Thus shall thou eat' refers to the sign position, being (Venus?) and the earth together with Sagittarius and Capricorn.  Three planets of the Earth: Mars, Mercury, Saturn, and the scene is in the middle of Aquarius.  The original motion of the lord was 240 from 0 degrees Aries to Sagittarius, followed by a new motion under a new name, a new cycle, that began at 0 Sagittarius and ended at 0 Capricorn, which measures 390 degrees.  This makes all total up till the time of creation of Mercury 630 degrees.  From then until we come to 15 degrees Aquarius, mars or mercury moved around on an extra 45 degrees, and saturn was at 15 degrees Aquarius.  'All days of thy life' means leave Saturn in Aquarius and do not try to put him in some other sign.  

It wasn't until BA understood Gann, then he could understand what Bayer was actually doing.  We have to investigate Bayer's writing style.  This is a key to understanding his writing style.  He'll give you the right elements, but he'll do something bizarre with them, that makes absolutely no sense.  That's the writing technique he used in this book.  We'll see this play out again.  The Bible is all about cycles.  What Bayer is referring to is cycles.  It is the types of cycles referred about in Turbo 2.  They are Biblical cycles.  They are written about in TTTA, and alblak wrote about them.  Everyone is writing about the same thing.  Gann was big on the cycle.  

What Bayer does is two things: 
1) He will give you the correct elements to work with.  For example, Snake stands for Saturn.  That is what is important.  It's when he tries to apply it, then he's kind of throwing you off.  But he wants you to take it and play with it; do your own work and draw your own conclusions with it.  Most people don't get about Bayer is that what he is doing, is that the examples he gives you aren't going to work.  

Bible interpretation is all about cycles.  

Everyone is talking about the biblical cycles.  When you get into application with Bayer, be very careful.  Nine times out of ten, BA has found they won't work, or they are so bizarre that they can never be tested to be right or wrong.  Page 15 is a very important part.  

The key to this field is cycles.  Bible Interpration is all about the cycles.  That's our motto.  

Page 22, figure 47 reveals: Mars rules Sagittarius and Capricorn.  His wife, Mercury, rules Gemini and Cancer.  Saturn rules Aquarius and Pisces.  His wife, the Sun, rules Leo and Virgo.  Jupiter rules Aries and Taurus.  His wife, Venus, rules Libra and Scorpio.  BA: BA is fairly exprimental with astrology, but taken literally, this is the craziest thing I've ever heard if you're an astrologer.  Why would Bayer write that?

Page 23, Verse 22: The flop over occurs at an angle 150 degrees.  Thus one planet's house to his next are always 150 degrees.  All of Mars, Saturn and Jupiter's signs now all turn out to be male.  All the Sun, Venus, and Mercury's signs prove to be female.  BA:  Taken literally, again, it's all bizarre craziness.  What you have to do is go in here and see what kind of elements he is actually working with.  These elements are important because it's what he wants you to see.  

Page 25, Verse 4 to 5:  Adam lived 930 years.  Log 930 = 2.96, the fixed value of 1 year = log alpha 3.76, these two terms added equal 6.73, this equals 5408.  This value added by 3600, i.e. converted to degrees, gives 1502 deg 18 min 20 sec.  This divided by 360 gives 4 revolutions of 360 degrees, and the rest of 62 deg 18 min 20 sec.  BA: That's real important there, what he wrote.  He's got some elements jumbled up, that's very important what he wrote.  If you go through this book, he writes these same things over and over.  He wants you to see something.  He's trying to help you find and understand these Biblical cycles.  He can't just come out and tell you because then everyone in the world would know what these cycles are.  He's gotta talk in a way to be 'on the fly' with things.  Is he right?  You betcha.  You can make money off of this knowledge.  

If you have the work "12", look at the pyramid.  These cycles are the second from the top.  In studying Bayer's books, always ask yourself which cycle in Turbo 2 is he talking about?  

Time Factors in the Stock Market by Bayer:  
This book is about Time Cycles and Time Factors.  

From page 10 and 11, he states, "Each motion is subject to retardation, unless an additional force is given to the object in motion, that is able to overcome the retarding forces.  What would enable it to stay continually in motion."  BA: He's talking about retrograde.  He's giving us a clue on how to handle retrograde.  

From page 20: "The planets being the nearest, this influence comprises the sequence and events of their lives."  He's giving us a clue there.  'sequence'.  Gann in TTTA mentions sequence too.  These things are covered by Gann and Jensen.  They are all trying to give us clues about the same thing.  They are all the same methods.  

From page 33: 'Wheels within wheels' concept is discussed again.  You should be able to figure approximately when and around what prices, clouds of trouble will appear.  The main laws here to be explained thereafter are the time laws.  

Page page 34: Price laws are also explained very carefully, but they must be subordinate to the time laws.  Thus on page 33 and 34, the relationship between time and price is hinted at.  This clearly shows Bayer is alluding to the fact that price projections are derived from these types cycles, making them an extremely important to get a handle on.  BA: If you want price, how are you going to get it?  Bayer is hinting to us that if you want price, you need to study these types of cycles.  Alblak has also told us the same thing in WITS.

From page 38, 39: "These formations, of course, are brought about by planetary constellations in the heavens.  As they change or repeat, the chart picture will change and repeat."  BA: He's trying to give us big clues here.  "Nevertheless we've reached 40 cents, my indicated price of the time, government or no government.  The specific law of the universe wanted wheat to sell at 40 cents, and not at one dollar, and it sold at 40 cents.  This planetary force is so tremendous and so sure of itself and of its operations and so easy to detect."  BA: What he's saying there is that these types of cycles is what is responsible for determining price.  Not your government or what your television says.  Prices and cycles are governed by the planets.  That's what Bayer states in this book.  

Page 46: Bottom 1/3rd of this page, Bayer goes into more specific Bible references and calculations.  He brings up the Adam cycle, which is 930 years, is equal to 800 plus 130 years or degrees.  Two different Jupiter cycles.  930 / 30 = 31.  Which is how long the Adam cycle must be, is what he tells us. 

Page 48: Bayer cites some of his own predictions for 32 or 33 stock market, and he states those were based on calculation.  Calculation showed it.  Calculating the motions of the planets.  He is clearly indicating his method.  This is important because this method is how you get price.  You cannot get price without calculating the motions of the planet.  

Analyst entering this field try to look at price first.  That's why they get stuck.  Price is govered by time, which is calculating the motions of the planets.  You have to understand that concept.  Without that concept understand fully understood, you don't have a chance.  

Page 51: "Therefore until the time you have mastered the methods to measure movements, the cold calculations of planetary movements, determining that time."  BA: Very important.

Page 54: "Ups and downs of such time cycles, which we may call vibrations, and after this he hands us successive divisions into smaller moves, thus again hinting at wheels within wheels.  These vibrations are the inner voice.  This inner force simply pushes a certain number of people to bring the stock to an intended stock level."  BA:  Bayer, Gann, Jensen, they found the proof of it, because they can measure it, and it's consistent.  That's the key to this field.  Cycles are responsible for price.  

Page 55: "Vibrations are calculated and plotted, provided you have a point of beginning."  In TTTA, Gann wrote: "If I have the correct beginning, I can get the correct ending."  They are both saying the same thing.  

Page 56: "Time is the most important factor in the movements."  BA:  Why is that?  It is because time tells you which points are connected.  Once we know which points are connected, we can measure price from it.  Go through WITS and look at the Alblak posts.  Pull them all out and study them.  You can see he is telling you that.  


Page 57: 144 years is mentioned without explanation.  We'll get into that later with Handbook of Trend Determination.  It's important that 144 years is mentioned here.  He's hinting to the square of 144.  There's a reason for that, because there is a connection there.  

Page 69: Bayer describes the biblical circle, which the prophets used as being 368 degrees 10 min 48 sec, and not 360 degrees.  Beginning at 13 deg 36 min 12 sec of Taurus, ending at 16 deg 21 min 48 sec of Virgo, which is the domain of the Sun.  Jupiter and Saturn dominates the other two domains.  The division relates to time, times, and a half.  BA: I first thought that this guy is out of his mind.  Later on I understood what that meant.  He's actually right!  The key is so important to understand.  It's like right there.  And he's actually right.  (rluu: check out the natal chart, and see if these points are in the natal.)

Page 72 and 73: Bayer goes into transits over certain fixed zodiac points.  Now the fast planets, except the moon.  He uses Mercury, Venus and Sun, mostly.  

Page 75, lower 1/3rd of that page: "Our laws are constant, good today and 10 years hence.  Only during transition periods when circles gradually increase or reduce in size, are complications apt to set in.  Although the time factor again takes care of this situation automatically.  The moment this time factor, caught up with the distance factor, there had to be a turn."  BA: Please spend some time thinking about that. 

Page 80: "Trade in stocks that you know, and in stocks that you have made profits.  Leave those stocks alone wherein you have taken big losses.  Never try to get even with a stock that caused a loss.  To do so will cause further losses.  Your vibrations are not atuned."   BA:  That's a major key.  I found a huge secret that really transformed my life, last year, that ties directly into this.  I found the cause.  I isolated the cause.  Gann tells us essentially the same thing.
  You'll know.  If you've got 3 losing trades in a row... get out of it.  This is a very important thing for profits.  There's a law behind it.  

Page 86 and 88: Bayer goes into the variations of the eccentricities of the moon.  He goes into complicated astronomical calculations.  BA: Today, you don't need complicated astronomical calculations.  The people who know Gann's system, they know price, and they aren't doing complicated things.  If you're doing complicated calculations, you are probably heading down the wrong road.  Gann is well hidden, but not complicated.  

Page 112: "Everything that is measured therein in degrees, years, or days, is meant to be part of 368 deg 6 minutes, and not a part of 360 degrees."  BA:  This is a very important sentence.  

Page 113, 114: Book of number.  Count of population again.  Total is 601730, which equals 601 deg 73 min, or 602 deg, 13 min, and deducing 360 degrees, equals 243 deg 13 min.  BA: Very important part.  

Page 129: "Each stock (and commodities) reacts at specific degrees and minutes of the zodiac, to one or two planets and to one or two positions.  Taking wheat for example, we note that Venus and Mars, and no other planets bring about change.  These two planets, as they cross 23 deg 20 min respectively and 12 deg 16 min of a sign, produce changes.  This statement is not correct for time cycles, as wheat is governed by other planets as well."  BA: Here he is doing a mix on us, talking about a different type of cycle.  He is talking about natal cycles.  The unsuspecting reader would be completely totally off trying to use this as a base for Time Cycles.  It's important to distinguish what type of cycles he is talking about?  How would you do that without knowing a cycle, and how a cycle operates.  That's the real key, and that's what this series is expounding on.  

Handbook of Trend Determination:
Throughout that book, Bayer has all these rules.  He gives you rule after rule after rule... he uses a different system.  It's sad, but it drives traders crazy.  If you go and try to apply the rules, you'll find that the rules are not what they are cracked up to be.  The reason is because he is doing something very secret in that book.  This book is all about the square of 144.  Which type of cycles do you think we use with the square of 144?  Which type of cycles will you have to have had mastered before you can open this book, which is all about the square of 144?  Why would they be mentioned in this book that we just reviewed?  

BA: This CD is packed with information... I want you to listen to it multiple times.  When this CD is over, put it down for a few days, then go back and listen to it again.  Because this CD is packed.  Each time you listen to this CD, you're going to hear something, something will click for you that didn't hear before.  Over time, you'll get aquainted with the concepts, and you'll understand that the information in the CDs is correct.  BA wanted to put out a high quality and truthful representation of what this field is really about.  

BA: Don't touch this book (Handbook of Trend Determination) until you understand the cycles that that square is based off of.  Because without those cycles, you won't know which time points are connected, and you won't know to anchor the square, and you certainly won't know how to use the square.  It'll all seem random to you.  This entire field operates off of cycles.  You have to have the cycles before you work with the squares.  You have to understand the cycles.  It's all about the cycles.  


George Wollstein by Bayer:
Page 44: Important to notice that the market is in operation every day.  That means even though the markets aren't open every day, the cycles are still in operating.  

Page 55, 56: Important to see both bull and bear sides of the market.  Advances might take more time than the bear moves.  

Page 63: At the old book store. Literature references: 'The Silver Panic of 1893'.  'Sepharial's Key to Market Operations'.  'Successful Methods For Wall Street Speciulation'.  The Sepharial reference is also found on page 68, 'Key to Market Trading', by Sepharial.  WITS can't find these books (yet).  WITS is willing to pay for them if you know someone that has the book.  

Page 69: Planets affect the market.  BA: Bayer worked with the planets as well as Gann did.

Page 71: The market is predictable.  It is important to study market data, high and low, several years back, in order to make predictions. 

Page 73: The price movements are independant of the season of the year.  BA: What he means there is that say for every fall season, wheat doesn't always go down.  In the Fall season of some years, wheat will go up.  That's what he means there.  

Page 81: One factor is to consider is to study the volume.  For example 1907, the volume is strong at the top as well as at the bottom area.  Gann was also big on volume.  

Page 82, 83: Explanation of the waves in the market, ie. first an upward trend, followed by a recession.  When a rise the second time starts, it will continue for a long time with increasing prices, with volume as well.  BA:  What Bayer is saying here is to measure the volume of the moves.  

Page 88:
Gaps made in the price structure.  Factors like management of corportions, output, manufacturers, services, do not influence the price of stock.  BA: BA's experience confirms this.  In actuality, when you deal with the causes like Gann tells us to, that's not what you find ocurring.  

Page 91: 
Reference to Sepharial's 'Key to Successful Trading'.  This book contains explanations of planetary movements and angular distances, conjunctions, trines also, between the planets.  This is important to study as planets are involved in market movements.  WITS has been having trouble finding these books.  

Page 99:
Crossing of Saturn and Jupiter by Mercury.  In this case, points where Saturn and Jupiter, heliocentric longitude, are crossed by heliocentric Mercury longitude.

Page 100:
It is stated that economic movements of commodity and stock prices can be better predicted by these methods than the methods used by professors at the universities.  BA: Absolutely!  

Page 101, 102:
Further dates of heliocentric Mercury longitude lines crossing Saturn and Jupiter heliocentric longitudes.  

Page 104:
Jupiter or Saturn, in combination with Mercury, is what makes the method work.  The author says that Geocentric positions should not be considered.  BA: The Geocentric positions absolutely should be considered.  These types of cycles work both at geocentrically and heliocentrically.  BLH also says she uses heliocentric planets.  

Page 109:
In Sepharial's book, nothing whatsoever was mentioned about heliocentric positions of the planets.  Everything was traded was intented for geocentric positions.  There are books containing geocentric positions.  Geocentric aspects like conjunction or square mean absolutely nothing for trading grains, nor for anything else.  They are merely illusions, they might hit a top or bottom, but he who puts any reliance on them, will soon find themselves in hot water.  They also occur so frequently that every day or two, one such aspect might be due.  The direction of the movement cannot be judged either, since a square might generate a up move or a down move, and so with the rest of such aspects.  George had worked according to Sepharials' instructions but used heliocentric positions instead, and his method was right.  BA:  Sounds like he is adament that geocentric dont' work.  I know a ton of people who make money off of the geocentric cycles.  But he is also right, in that the method he is talking about here is different than the method that he is describing in the book (elsewhere).  He's alluding to a certain method in this book, and the method that he is talking about here is not that method.  So he's doing a mix on ya... it is very misleading.  The up and down movement in stocks are not influenced by a square aspect.  The actual direction of the movement of the markets are determined by the cycles that he is describing in this work.  

Page 120:
George used the method with heliocentric longitude position for Jupiter and Saturn, in combination with Mercury for trading wheat.  

Page 121: 
Heliocentric is described as planets around the Sun. Geocentric is planets described around earth.  

Page 140:
Geocentric positions did not appeal to George.  Mercury and other planets were moving backwards when viewed from the Earth.  Heliocentric movements are always going forward.  Going backwards means pleasure and should not be considered in scientific work.  BA: Bayer is directly lying to you here.  Cycles are both geocentric and heliocentric.  At least in the form of the cycles that he is trying to describe in this work.

Page 141:
Regarding the 'F' word.  Does the 'I' of the word not sound like up, joo hoo, and does it 'F' not sound like the smell of a foul egg, with the egg between the 'I' and the 'F'?  The german word for breath is 'atim', breath up and breathe down.  The first of the bible, the author had worked out a method of astrology where he used one single horoscope the way astrologers use 5 others... all arrived from that one.  Astrologer that puts that to test will fail, as they can't predict the precision to a day... but like more than a week's difference. BA: He is right in one way, but wrong in another.  Depends on how you view that.  
rluu: Check the George Wollsten book and correct the above quote.

Page 142 to over 200:
Bayer is using ellipses.  The 71 and 78 degrees in the jiggle lines.  BA:  He knows people who have tried desperately to crack this.  BA doesn't know anyone who has cracked it without knowing the cycles.  

Page 208, 209:
George gives a lot of reasons for selling on July 21, 1910.  BA: The point here is that at the highs and lows, there is a lot going on.  There is more than one way to skin the cat.  At a significant high or low, you'll have a lot of cycles tie into that high or low.  

Page 215, 216:
He had switched the options on August 2, 1910 on his chart from September to May.  The September price is $1.00 and now he has marked it as $1.10.  The 10 cent difference was both options on August 2.  As soon the option had pretty well run through the approach of the time, the cash wheat, he switches prices of the chart to the latter option.  From September option he switched into May, then again into September.  In order to avoid the gap in the chart, George plotted the May $1.10, at the $1.00 price, with the chart renumbered.  Next March he would switch into September option again, and forget the May option.  BA:  This is a very important point here because what he is doing is changing the prices so that the prices can be lined up.  This is done by Gann traders so that the prices can be forecasted correctly.  

Page 222:
With our three planets alone, Mercury, Jupiter, Saturn, it is important to see the horse in the whip, as smaller swings caused by our three planets are hidden in the horse whip. 

Page 222, 223:
Squaring of the circle.  It's important, but remember, the key here is cycles.  In this squaring of the circle, he uses three circles.

Page 225:
He uses 17.5, 52, 70, etc.  There are all harmonics.  It's true that stocks and commodities do have their own numbers, but keep yourself focused on cycles, then head over to price.

Turning 400 Years of Astrology to Practical Use:
Page 9: 
Going back some 600 or 800 years, subjects of ancient books was always about gods and their doings.  Constantly about astrology.  Bayer is absolutely correct here. 

Page 19:
Bayer suggested an astrologer should at all times carry around a clock and a notebook and take notes of events and their times, then some of these time point will aid one in finding one's own natal time point.  This method is known as diurnals and is made public by Sepharial in Modern Astrology magazine in 1895.  

Page 23:
Bayer shows progressions, in that one year is equivalent to one day measured from the birth date.  This is called solar arcs.

Page 28:
All 15-degree aspects are used.  Also Bayer says to never use 12, 24, or other subdivisions.  I mentioned them to draw your attention to the past that must be entered into.  BA: The truth is that this depends on the type of cycle that you are working with.  

Page 58:
Bayer is talking about how he used time transits over natal, but used them with little advantage.  Use them only occasionally when ascendant is correct.  BA:  This is because an ascendant will produce turns when hit by transiting planets.  That's the point he's driving at.

Page 59:
Bayer says not to pay attention to where they are in signs, just know where they are in relation to the moon.  BA:  His point here that the moon can act as a trigger, and over does. 

Page 60:
Five-fold horoscope for greece rule.  BA:  We need to know this fancy stuff?  We need to know the cycles.  Keep that in mind.  This field is all about cycles.  You don't need the five-fold horoscope to successful.  You need cycles!  You need to understand price which comes off of certain cycles.  Don't pay any attention to this fancy stuff.  It'll lose ya.  Pay attention to the cycles. 

Page 66:
The progressed moon is the actor.  It causes by it's progressed motion from day to day aspects to be formed towards other planets.  The progressed moon is the corpret in all cases.  All other progressed planets are ignored except when they get aspects themselves from the progressed moon.  BA:  The point here is that the progressed moon will show up at turns. 

Page 116, 119:
Bayer discusses the NYSE natal, and corrections thereof.  Argues for different natal times and dates, depending on which position in the chart you look at.  See especially page 119, top half.  The planets started and acted at different moment, first one and then another, until all of them worked.  BA:  Using BA's own natal methods, BA came up with a time independently and got a time just two minutes off of the time Bayer says.  The NYSE time of 11:15 May 17th, 1792.  Bayer says not to use that time... he's lying to you!  BA's methods got a time two minutes off of that.  

Page 124:
When stocks becomes leaders of the market, the progressed moon of their own horoscope moves at the same speed.  The same increase or decrease, as the progressed moon of the market horoscope of 1792.  BA:  Test it, because the progressed moon is important.  

Page 125:
Bayer gives various natal dates, based on first trade dates.  Among those, US Steel and Cotton.  BA:  A first trade date for a stock is never under any circumstance, a natal.  It cannot be.  I've proved this time and time again in my work.  I have never seen a first trade date in time correspond to the correct natal of a stock. 

Page 128:
Bayer reveals a secret.  See what happens when Venus in the sky passes the ascendant of January 2nd, 1587 chart.  9 times out of 10, the actual direction of wheat will change.  The moment the ephemeral Venus strikes 2 deg 24 min, and 17 deg 24 min of any sign.  Bayer gives example dates.  BA:  Each stock and commodity has these active points.  They will be different in each one, but the point here is these active points, which is really the ascendant.  Once they get hit though, they produce turns.  This cycle is known as the natal chart cycles.  These cycles are natal cycles.  

Page 141:
Cleffs in music.  Violin, alto, tenor and bass keys.  Bayer suggests we read about harmony and about sound, concord, and discord.  Violin key equals small jiggles (the jiggle line) in the market; alto key, small swings of a few days, tenor key, bigger swings of one to six weeks; bass key, major bull and bear cycles.  

Also, violin key marked as half-moon with a dot below.  And usually the pair of symbols, or whatever the clash makers' name is, two round brass plates, strikes at that time for a good sensational ending.  This represents the last explosion, just before the nuts crack.  I.e. just before the nosedive.  See what I have said about this phase in my Egg of Columbus.  BA:  Very important passage.  

Page 183:
I found a thousand dollar bill.  I kept it, worked on it many hours each day to recognize it's genius-ness.  This represents the eyes of the lady spoken by Goeth.  


BA:  I tried to give you the important parts.  To help you in your foundation.  Remember the key to this field is about cycles.  This field is all about cycles.  The reason why Bayer is so important is because he talked about all these cycles.  

BA:  I've talked to people who have studied Bayer for 30 years, and can't trade.  Their main problem is that they studied the wrong things... focusing on elements that made sense to them as laymen, such as ellipses, jiggle lines, or five-fold.  There never understood this piece of information: It's all about cycles.  Look for different types of cycles. 

BA:  About the five-fold horoscope.  It's complicated.  Why take on something so complicated without years of astrological experience under your belt.  Instead spend your time with cycles, not stuff like the five-fold.  This field is all about cycles.  Spend your time cycle-hunting and figuring out the cycles first.  

BA:  Each stock or commodity vibrates to it's own cycles of the types mentioned in Turbo 2.  That is the basis of the field.  A cycle will repeat, like when a point of the zodiac gets hit, cycle type: natal, ascendant getting hit; or the response of a stock/commodity to a planetary pair, which is cycle type: transiting.  Spend your time looking for reoccuring cycles.  Stay away from ellipses and other seemlingly non-cycle information.  Bayer and Gann knew and used the same techniques.  Once you understand the cycles, the Egg of Columbus, the TTTA (what he means in the foreward...), you can easily see he means the same thing between Bayer and Gann.  In Bayer's books, the premises are different between each book.  Each book contains a different cyclical method.  The squares are only shorthand for describing the cycles described in Bayer's books.  Bayer knew about the square of 144, which he wrote about in Handbook of Trend Determination.  

BA:  It all boils down to the cycles.  That's the heart of the entire field.  Take the scientific approach and use the cycles mentioned in Turbo 2.
