CD says this Turbo was recorded Jan 2006.

About WITS:
Place to share unbiased research without the negative elements of other sites.
Other sites were overrun by vendors and marketers.

WITS does not have vendors, per se.  Generally will not have vendors.

Many successful members have come out of WITS.  You can see these people coming through the site, as they grow.  

BA is talking about important members.

Haytham started posting around June 2001.  Study his posts.  Pull out all his posts and put it in a file.
H.Albizem@worldnet.att.net
gann_trader_19

Allan Blakstad.
Study his posts.  Post 13476 talks about how Gann used the squares.  Covers the coffee letter.  Go through Alblak's posts and create a study file.

Lorin Baker.
He posts his market calls, techniques, etc.  Uses geometry.

W.D. Gann also predicted worldly events.  Posts 11473, 12493, both start series on mundane predictions.


Reloaded series: Nov 30, 2003, Post 12659.

Quarters series: Post 12661.

About TAC, who started with families and not knowing anything.  13 months later, they started making accurate market calls.  Post 15179.  

WITS uses the Solaris site as a backup site.  This was needed because Yahoo stopped supporting the archiving of attachments.  It is a manual process to do the archiving.

In the WITS library: Ancient books, rare documents.  

BA has been in the (trading) field since around 1996.

Start out with:
1) Gann's master stock course and Gann's master commodity course.  
These works shows the application of his system.  But you need to study TTTA to get the system.

2) TTTA
Gann's system is in this book.

3) The Power of Numbers by Numero.  
He shows a simple technique of how you can work with numbers to achieve results.  It's just the first step.

4) Kabala of Numbers by Sepharial.  Then read anything by Sepharial.
Sepharial was the most represented author on the Gann reading list.


The coffee letter shows that Gann definitely used astrology.  TTTA
shows that Gann used astrology also.  All the people who have been able to make some market calls in WITS use astrology.  


The Squares run off of cycles.  These cycles are found in TTTA.  Until you understand the cycles, you're not going to get the squares working.  How do you what cycle number to anchor it to?  You don't.  You have to get the cycles working first.  

Ruth Miller has a book out.  She is a WITS member.  rmiller@otecom.net  (BA said that may not be the exact email, but it is close) She has the actual method that W.D. Gann used.  It's in "The Corn Method".  Gann used the Sq. of 9 in the same method that she talks about in that book.  The Sq. of 9 is a calculator.  

You'll see factors repeated in the Stock, Commodity courses and TTTA.  

Keep in mind, you don't necessarily need Gann to make money in the markets.

After reading the books mentioned above, decide where you want to take your research.  You can email people on WITS.  Get out there and interact and meet people like you who want to succeeed.  

WITS has seminars.  They try to make it very affordable.  You want to meet people and work together with people at these.  

The WITS library is for the serious researcher.  It's going to take time, but it's well worth it.  Many people have 9-5 jobs, families, etc.  If you are really serious, WITS is a fantastic forum.  

Post 24730, by super_romeman.  Oct. 11, 2005.  Exerpts from Gann's book about Max Pete.  

"I was able to catch its moves up and down over 90 per cent of the time just the same as if I had been making the fluctuations myself. Many other stocks work just as well as this for me, while others do not favor me and I have never made any money out of them. It makes no difference whether you know or do not know the reason why a thing works or does not work; just as soon as experience teaches you that there is something that works against you, the only thing to do is to quit."  
W. D. Gann, Truth of the Stock Tape, p. 75


BA says he knows people that can make money without Gann.  Some of these people don't even have a system.  One thing about all these people is that they found a stock they can consistently make money in.  

One thing to try is to paper trade it first.  Stay away from stocks that are bad to you.  Stick with the stocks that are good to you.  

If you are after a system, you have to find a system that works for you.  

The way to approach people (to write a private email to the person), make sure you have some knowledge.  Come on like you actually have done some homework, like you have tried to find the answer yourself.  

Books that WITS is trying to get ahold of: Those by Jensen and Sepharial.  

Sometimes WITS members will be unwilling to fully elaborate on a topic.  Some people have spent years on this, and they might feel you need to put some time into it.  You might get a flakey answer.  Be aware that this might happen.  It might take some time to gain respect, and then they can see eye to eye with you.

In their formative years, the communication might have been hard.  Back then, it was over paper mail.  

WITS will tell you what to study, and what not to study.

There's different areas of Gann:
Astrology 
Numerology
Mild Geometry.

Good primer and beginning astro book:
Jensen's Astro Cycles and Speculative Markets.

Good advanced book:
"12"

BA says "12" costs 480 dollars (in 2006).  rluu: I'm not sure how much it costs now.  

They used to sell the book "6", now they sell "12".  It is created by many WITS members.

Discoveries definitely make it all worthwhile.  There's different levels in this field.  We all have to go through out own paths.  There's nothing more exciting than making a discovery.  

When you realize how something works, it generally is a shock.  There's a mental relief that you experience.  It's the "ah ha!".  

The financial markets work off of natural laws.  These laws are totally understandable.  It's like gravity.  The natural law is always in effect. 

Gann, Bayer, Jensen, did not believe markets are random.  Markets work by natural laws, and these laws can be understood.  These laws are always operable in financial markets.  Discovering even some of these natural laws will lead to profit.  

George Bayer used Gann's systems.  We have his material in the WITS library.

Many people have been able to replicate Gann.  There's people alive who can trade better than Gann.  This is due to better knowledge and better equiptment (computers) to avoid human errors.

Gann's primary astrologers (both employed by Gann):
Lurther Jensen - Under the guise of the Kansas City Bureau of Economic Research
Johndro - "Earth in the Heavens".  "Fixed Stars".  Both his books are in the WITS library.

Gann died in 1955.  He lived in an era where astrology was totally unacceptable.  Today astrology is still not acceptable, but more acceptable than before.  

Gann had a very religious wife.  Gann was not religious (he didn't go to church).  

Gann's own son was made by the mother to turn against Gann himself.  When Gann died, Gann's son and his mother ran to the bank to see what money was left.  THere was only about $100,000 and they were pissed off.  Gann's son then said that all Gann got all his money from selling books.  

W.D. Gann would go to these lotteries in cuba.  At the time, the American mobs controlled the Cuban casino.  Gann would go down there, and due to certain formuas he had, he would break them.  They got sick of him winning and winning.  So they poisoned him.  On his way back on his airplane, he was complaining of chest pains, and he landed in miami, rushed to the hospital where he died.  

There were papers at his house that he left orders to be burned by his lawyer.  The papers did get burned, but there are documents that escaped via a different route.  BA knows where the documents are and who's got them, but he can't disclose that.  So there's still a lot of information out there.

So what happened to the money?  Gann's next door neighbor was an international lawyer who set up a trust in the Bahamas.  The profits from his trading account was cyphoned into the Bahamas bank, where it remains today.  He is reported to have taken 50 million dollars out of the markets.  That's where it is at.  

You don't need complicated astrology.  You don't need Vedic astrology.  BA has never seen Gann use it.  Gann used simple astrology.  A good book for a beginning foundation is Luther Jensen's ACSM.


Traders today can replicate Gann's type of results.  

Everyone in this field has their other path.  The function of the CD is to give paths that you can begin with.  The goal is to trade profitably, consistently.  You can wait till you get Gann's system, or you can trade now.  Then the goal is to acquire a system or to acquire a better system.  There are systems in "12".  There are systems in WITS.  There is plenty of information.  

Stick to stocks that are good to you.  Avoid the ones that are not good to you. 

The real key to Gann is cycles.  You have to understand the cycles.  Without doing that you will never understand Gann's systems.  Your real goal is to get the cycles.  YOU HAVE TO GET THE CYCLES.  There is no other way.  

Gann's audited financial records was read by BA.  Accuracy percentages.

Go to the Solaris site and look at the Gann Coffee Letter, in writings of W.D. Gann.  In that, you will see what Gann is doing.  He had a student sign a non-disclosure, and then Gann died, and he disclosed it.  The coffee letter has astrology in it.  

It is actually a mix between astrology and astronomy.  There are two main systems in an Ephemeris: Geocentric and Heliocentric.  Both of these have validity in cycles.  You can pull cycles out of both systems.  

Free software: Astrolog

When you're ready to get software that does more, you can go get Solar Fire.  But you don't need that.  

Signs of the zodiac is given by BA:
Aries, Taurus, Gemini, Cancer, Leo, Virgo, Libra, Scorpio, Sagittarius, Capricorn, Aquarius.  
Each has 30 degrees.

BA mentions declinations of planets (where the planets are up and down).  It is very important in this field.  Min and max declination of the Sun (at the solstices): 23 degrees 27 minutes.  

Natals.  A natal is simply a snapshot of where the planets are at a given moment of time.  In Gann terms, the snapshot is taken at the beginning of something.  Natals contain sensitive points.  As planets move around the zodiac, it is going to hit these sensitive points, which will cause a market to turn. 

Post 26749: You can take these sensitive points and calculate when a turn will happen.  This post covers application to markets.  

Planet ingress has significance.  

When planets hit their max North or South declination, or 0 declination will cause turns in some markets.  Some stocks and some commodities will turn on these dates for Mars.

Planets move in ellipses.  When they are closest to the Sun, they move the fastest.  When they are further, they move slower.  Planets that are closer to the Sun have smaller periods.  

84 year cycle in the U.S. of revolutions.  

There are:
20 year cycles
4-minute cycles

Perihelion - When planet is closest to the Sun.
Aphelion - When planet is furthest from the Sun.

There are systems that are based on perihelion and aphelion. 

Fixed stars.

North node is a very important point.  18.6 year revolution.  Some trading systems use it, including Gann's.  Always use the True Node.  Gann did not have the True node available.  You need to use the mean node when following him.  He would have used true node if he had it.  

Two planets that you need to be aware of:
Chiron - About 52 year revolution.  Chiron rules Taurus.
Transpluto - Rules Virgo.

These definitely have effects and definitely turn markets.  

Example:
Plug in:
May 24, 1981.
4:46 am 
Central Daylight Time (+5:00)
Chicago, Illinois.

Ascendant: 19 Taurus 49

Critical points of chart:
Ascendant - Very important point.  Used to call turns.
Midheaven - MC


Example:
McDonald's - True natal that the price is vibrating to.
Dec. 12, 1949 (Later in the recording BA says it is 1948.  rluu: Wikipedia gives the date December 12, 1948 as a date when McDonald's was first opened with that name.)
2:18 pm
Pacific standard time (+8:00)
San Bernardino, California

Ascendant: 11 Taurus 57
Midheaven: 26 Capricorn 42


This should be about enough to start calling turns.  It's in how you use this knowledge.  This is a good starting foundation.  

BLH in her lecture uses Moon declination points at max north, max south, and 0 points.  You can make a lot of money off of just this system.  

The Ascendant and MC points have effects.  


Example:
Mars position at 12 Capricorn 15.  
When a certain planet transits that point, you could get a turn if that point is active.  



##############################################################################
Turbo 2.
##############################################################################

Gets into direct market application.  We will see how turns are made, and how these factors and time those turns. 

Turbo 2 is about: Cycles in stocks and commodities.

Master rule: Each stock or commodity responds to its own cycles, which are independent of cycles of other stocks or commodities.  

The job of the market technicians is to find these cycles.

We break them down into the 4 main cycles:
Declination
Longitude
Time cycles
Hits to natals.


Gann had a list for of each stock or commodity that he traded.  The list was comprised of the cycles that that stock or commodity would respond to.  Like venus aspecting mars, new moon, jupiter aspecting saturn, etc.  Each of those are cycles.  Some will respond to a different commodity than others.  What you can do is make a list for whatever stock or commodity you are studying.  


The way to tel is go through past data to see if it has a history of responding to an astrological event.  The way to do this is set up tests. 

The function of this CD is to get into that.  This is what Bayer, Gann and Jensen were doing.  They were all into cycle work.  They would extract these cycles.  If we want to emulate them, this is what we have to do.  


1) Declination cycles.  There are two types:  
   - Based on declination of a single planet.  
   - Based on Two or more planets; their relationship to each other.  

BLH talks about moon hitting 0 south and cotton changing direction about 50% of the time.  This is in the BLH lecture.  This lecture occurs many times a year.  She separates this by rising market versus declining market (e.i. main trend up, versus main trend down).  If trend is up and moon hits 0 south, then cotton changes trend about 80% of the time.  If trend is down and moon hits 0 south, trend changes happen less than 50% of the time.  This is where typical astrologers go wrong.  They don't separate things like this.  We have to make this very important distinction between a rising or falling market.  

Some aspects will have no effect in a rising market, but will have an effect in a falling market.  Or vice versa.  

Each market has to be tested independently.  

The moon going 0 south in a rising cotton market, but will have no effect in wheat or Dow.  

Declination cycle between two or more planets: Parallel and contra-parallel aspects.  

Here in stocks, a good combination to get turns for stocks is usually: Transiting Sun parallel or contra-parallel Mercury.  However cotton or wheat may not respond to that.  Some market technicians eventually find this.  What is missing in the current day curriculum is that large turns occur when outer planets are close to a parallel or contra-parallel, and a fast moving planet, acting as a trigger, such as Mercury, Venus or Mars, makes a parallel or contra-parallel to those two planets that are coming into aspect.  

As an example, Jupiter at +13 deg 55 min of declination, and Saturn at +13 deg 48 min of declination, and a turn occurs when transiting Mercury hits +13 deg 51 min of declination.  Mercury is the trigger.  So that will time your turn.  

Another is transiting Saturn at +13 deg 48 min of declination, transiting Uranus at -13 deg 42 min of declination, turn occurs when Mars hits -13 deg 45 min declination.  Again the contra-parallel is setting up between Saturn and Uranus, and Mars is the trigger.  

You need to find which planets your stock responds to.  You need to go to highs and lows and see which planets affect your market.  If they are, then put it on your list of things affecting your stock or commodity.  

2) Time Cycles:  
Time Cycles uses a Time Factor.  The concept of a Time Factor is important in our field.

All the authors that could make consistent market calls talked about knowledge of the Time Factors. George Bayer wrote a book about it called Time Factors in the Stock Market.  Luther Jensen mentioned Time Factor on page 126 of his book.  Gann mentions Time Factor on page 62 of The Truth of the Stock Tape.  He also mentions it in TTTA on page 197, where he states "Great discovery of a Time Factor with which he figured Major Motors would decline until about June 30, 1927, then start an advance which would last until about September 16, 1927."  So Gann is actually giving us specific dates and saying there is a time factor here.  So if we need further information, we need to search the WITS archives on or about Time Factors.  I'm told these cycles are extremely important.  


3) Another type of cycle type: The Natal
In a natal chart, not all the points of the natal are active.  So it's up to the market technician to determine which point(s) produce price turns, and which do not.  A 15-degree axis is employed.  

Using McDonalds: Asc 11 Taurus 57.  Use this as an anchor to determine the other points on the 15-degree axis (all around the circle).  This gives us 24 points all around the circle.  

WITS Posts at the end of 2005, there are WITS post about this 15-degree axis. 
Do a search for: "15 degree axis" 

If this point (the ascendant) is active, then when a planet hits any of the 15-degree axis points, then we will get turns.  Let's look at a one-year time frame in McDonalds stock: July 1997, to July 1998.  On 7/7/1998, Uranus was at 11 Aquarius 47.  There's a note here, we are using an orb of 10 minutes on either side of exact.  This gives us a 20 minutes swath.  

There's a way to determine in advance exactly when the point will be triggered.  The exact day of a turn can be known in advance.  BA is going to leave it for us to find.  He did a call around early November 2005.  He used a very close moving planet; he used Saturn; and he used the natal.  On 7/30/1997, Chiron was at 26 Libra 56.  Both of these points are on the axis.  They are all on our 11 Taurus 57 axis.  Looking at the turn is very impressive.  Note also 7/7/1998, transiting Mercury is in opposition to transiting Uranus.  Transiting Uranus was on the axis.  It can be readily observed that the ascendant is an active point on the natal of McDonalds.  And there are more active points in that natal.  

The natal will consistently produce turns.  It's an awesome timer.  It's going to take you a while to learn it.  It is worth it because it pays well.  It pays well in money and in freedom.  

George Bayer wrote about natals.  Gann has hand-drawn chart of natals.  Jensen wrote about natals.  Natals are a type of cycle.  They produce turns.  

4) Straight longitudal aspect.  It is an aspect between two planets.  You use the 15-axis.  Every time they (the two planets) are a multiple of 15 degrees apart, you look for turns.  There is a scientific way to test that.  Each stock or commodity responds to it's own planets.  Your goal as a trader is to find which planets dominate your stock or commodity.  What Gann did for this, was he actually had a list of aspects that would affect that particular stock or commodity.  He did this for his long term trading of course, not for his intraday stuff.  For example for Soybeans, he went through and went to see which one of the longitudinal aspects would worked, which one of the lunar aspected workd, which one of the declinations it would respond to.  And he would compile a list of this, and he would use other techniques and other cycles to confirm a turn.  Jensen says to use 6 degrees approaching or pass for an aspect.  We can't do that here.  BA says to use 10 minutes of orb either side.  

A lot of people are taking Jensen's work out of context.  You can't do 6 degree orb.  What Jensen was doing was saying 6 degrees, but that was for something else from what we are doing here.  

For example: For a Jupiter-Uranus 120 degree aspect, we would look the swath (range) of 119 deg 50 min, to 120 deg 10 min.  That's a 20 minute swath, or 10 minutes on either side.  If a turn happened within this time frame, then we would take it as a turn, and if it did not, then it would not count as a turn.  We would take all these aspects over a long period of time.  We would want to do around 40, 50, or 60, per planetary pair.  BA would do about 200 aspects, to get a good set, and then he would take a look at the percentages that would make turns.  


In stocks or commodity, there is a varying of strengths of cycles.  Some will be weak and some will be strong.  You have to comb those cycles out.  Gann would know out of those 4 types of cycles, he would know which ones of them was strongest in a particular stock or commodity, and which would be good for reinforcing.  He would have a list of what was operating in that stock or commodity.  

We want to do the same technique.  A good example that works: Jupiter and Uranus in the Spring for soybeans.  

Out of these 4 cycles, these are the primary cycles.  There are secondary ones that work, like solar arcs and BLH does some stuff on weather.  There are weather cycles, and other types of cycles, which are secondary cycles.  The 4 BA listed are what he calls the primary cycles.  

There's also a main tool that Gann used, which BA hasn't mentioned yet.  It's talked about in WITS Post 4484 through 4486.  It's also a very good starting point for work to do in that particular regard.  The goal is to get the cycles working so you can know when a turn is coming, so you know how to play the market.  

In Paris, alblak1940 said "There is a lot happening at highs and lows."  BA had been saying that for years.  BA says: "There is more than one way to skin the cat."  A lot of these cycles tie into each other.  You get double and triple confirmation at tops and bottom.  There are many cycles that lock into each other.  

Number one thing to do is to get these cycles working in your market.  




About Intraday trading: Gann definitely had an intraday system, which many traders are seeking.  That goal was held out a lot amongst BA's students.  Many traders are interested in intraday timing.  The fundamental problem is that the good traders wrote very little about intraday trading.  The information is not really out there.  

Gann's system is the ultimate in intraday trading.  

BA told this to someone privately about intraday: "Look this is the truth.  You'll going to have to get Gann's stuff working on a larger timeframe.  That's where people have writting the most.  Then you have to take that and take it down to the intraday level.  You can't hit it from moving straight into intraday.  You have to get his swing trading system, and get that down into the intraday format.  Now that's the truth."  It's the correct route.  

The other way to do it is to have someone spoon feed you the answers, and that doesn't happen in this field.  

Gann's intraday system is 100 times better than any other intraday system that BA has actually seen.  The reason for this is because he gets into the actual cause of the markets.  

For his system, you'll be able to see: There'll be a turn here at this time, a low here at this time, a high at this time.  That'll give you a perfect entry and exit point.  

Gann never wrote on his intraday trading.  So go for his swing trading, and bring it down to the intraday format.  Go for where the information is.  

The Gann trader will know what the day looks like before it happens.  Proof of this is in Haytham's WITS post 2926.  You need the attachments for this post.  The attachments are in the 'First two years of WITS' CD.  The intraday turns are shown.  What the post is called: "Exact points, law of vibration."  Many missed the forrest from the trees when he posted that.  The price action looks the same from the year before.  That's something to get you started on.  It's a big clue that Haytham would post something like that.  What Haytham did was take Gann's swing trading, and took it down to intraday.  

"Tunnel lock box" post.  There is a lot of information in WITS.  One of the posts that is one of BA's favorite is 1755.  On Oct. 5, 2001.  By Haytham.  This post has to do with the secrets in TTTA.  

He went back and re-did Gann's forecasts.  He did really good with it.  But he doesn't post anymore.  He kind of faded from posting, and he evolved.  

Some people post things in a matter of fact way.  There is good information. 

If you get stuck and have no more ideas, go back and read these posts.  

Alblak1940.  He is a great poster, great guy.  He's the real deal.  95% of what he says BA agrees with.  He did about 10 years of work on decoding TTTA.  He is very gifted in terms of decoding that book.  Make sure you go through and get all his posts.  

Gann's other books.  BA is always asked which ones to focus on.  Review of them:

Magic Word: The book is written in code.  BA says don't spend too much time on this.  

How to make money in Stocks and Commodities. 
Truth of the Stock Tape.  
Wall Street Stock Selector. 

WITS doesn't have these books due to copyright laws.  Supposely these books are still under copyright.  These books are available from Lambert Gann Publishing.  All these contain market data and a few clues sprinkled about.  For example Time Factors. 

You can succeed without these books.  But you can't succeed without mastering TTTA.  It won't hurt to read these books, but keep your focus on TTTA.  When reading the other books, dog-ear the pages that seems outside the common information, or if it contains anything on cycles.  

Sometimes he talks about a stock did this or that... and then he'll back up and give you a reason.  It's those reasons and subsequent information that you want to pay attention to.  Mark these places.  

Examples of 'outside information':
pg. 75 of Truth of the Stock Tape.  
Chapter. 1 of Wall Street Stock Selector.  (Complete chapter on cycles).

If you get to something about a topic in TTTA, and then you'll want to test it somewhere, you can go back to these books other books of Gann.  And you can go straight to the other books, and flip through the material from Gann's other books.  The main system is in TTTA. 

Another book:
45 Years on Wall Street:
It is written in a way where Gann wants you to work through the data.  Because he is going through all this stuff and you have no idea what he is doing.  You need to first acquire Gann's system in TTTA, before you work on this books.  Why did he use '45 years', when at the end he says his experience was not actually 45 years?  (rluu: Because 45 years is 1/8th of a circle).  

The Master Courses:
Many don't get anything out of them that is consistent.  It is just a collection of some of these courses.  Some courses are in private hands, and some courses are in a vault.  Gann would make some changes to the courses over time, so there are different versions of the same course.  

The actual systems that Gann used is in TTTA.  You can bounce some ideas off of the master courses, but the main information is in TTTA.  A lot of really smart people have tried to find the system in master courses, but they couldn't do it.  They got it throught TTTA.  

Recap:
There are 4 primary cycles.
Our goal is to forecast financial markets in advance.  We need to utilize at least one of those cycles mentioned previously to do this.  

Where we are going to take this series:
There are three authors; they are Gann, Bayer and Jensen.  All three of these authors were equally successful... meaning they knew the same techniques.  They wrote differently, but they knew the same systems.  They had equal knowledge.  You need to find which one of these you can understand better for yourself.  

Assignment:
Get one of those 4 cycles working.  Get a minimum of one working, and you will start to see things working.  That's all you need.  That's the correct approach.
