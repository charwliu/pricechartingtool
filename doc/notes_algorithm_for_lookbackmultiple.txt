Notes algorithm for lookback multiple:

1) Clear all LookbackMultiplePriceBarGraphicsItems (these contain the references to the LookbackMultiplePriceBars, which garbage collect them as needed).  These should be removed from the graphics scene.  

2) Get viewport of the PCD.  
3) From the viewport, get the start and end timestamps visable in teh viewport, via converting to scene coordinates, and then converting to timestamps.  

Now we have for the current period:
  - start timestamp
  - end timestamp

4) For the start timestamp:
   - Get the lookback timestamps (could be 1 or 3 timestamps, depending on retrograde movements).
   - Get the EARLIEST of the timestamps.
   - Get the historic pricebar that occurs BEFORE this lookback timestamp.

This is the start historic pricebar (inclusive).

5) For the end timestamp:
   - Get the lookback timestamps (could be 1 or 3 timestamps, depending on retrograde movements).
   - Get the LATEST of the timestamps.
   - Get the historic pricebar that occurs AFTER this lookback timestamp.

This is the end historic pricebar (inclusive).

6) Get list of pricebars in the time between (inclusive) the start historic pricebar and the end historic pricebar.  

7) For each pricebar in the list:
   - Get pricebar timestamp
   - Get the lookforward timestamps (could be 1 or 3 timestamps, depending on retrograde movements).

     For each lookforward timestamp: 
      - Create LookbackMultiplePriceBar.
      - Create LookbackMultiplePriceBarGraphicsItem.

8) Collect all the LookbackMultiplePriceBarGraphicsItem / LookbackMultiplePriceBar objects.  These are stored for further processing, and also if the user clicks apply/redraw again, all these objects will need to be removed from the scene.  

9) From the viewport of the PCD, determine max and min prices of what is displayed.

10) From all the LookbackMultiplePriceBarGraphicsItem / LookbackMultiplePriceBar objects, determine the max and min prices of these.

 - Determine offset, and scaling factors.  Then apply it to the LookbackMultiplePriceBarGraphicsItem / LookbackMultiplePriceBar objects.
