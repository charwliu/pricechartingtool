Information and notes for my research on futures: December and May Coffee.

rluu_20140114:
Tried to test H.Mars/H.Jupiter 625 deg on December coffee.  It didn't work out very well.  Not sure if it's because the turns I picked were not clear, or if it is because it is not the right cycle length.  

rluu_20140308:
H.Mars/H.Jupiter 2185 degrees works kinda well.  It is 6 rev + 25 degrees.

I don't know if it's 100% correct, but I got this length from TTTA while checking the approximate distance between:
- Attack on SF [Sept. 1930] [pg. 292-293]
- 1917-04-06 when war broke out in Europe. [pg. 10-11] 
  [First bicycle to ride on water].

This is approximately 13 years and 5 months.
I knew that Mars was involved, because Mars is Jupiter - 1, and Mars revolution is > 600 days.
But since it was such a large distance in time, I knew that a larger planet needed to be involved, so I checked Jupiter.

I don't think that bicycle length is the complete Tokyo J-1 though, because I think H.Mercury is involved also in some way.  

So more work needs to be done, but this bicycle works pretty well for the parts that I have mapped out [1993-11-03 to 1995-11-13].  I need to get data for the current period and then forecast out into the future.


rluu_20140308:  Hmm, checking out the current period, some parts seem reliable and some parts not so much.  There are just too many weekend periods to be absolutely sure.  I think I need more confidence that what I found in TTTA is absolutely correct.


rluu_20140320:
1906-06-06 to 1927-05-01 is: 9 rev + 129 deg. of H.Mars/H.Jupiter.
