Information and notes for my research on futures: July Wheat.  


rluu_20131024:
5 rev of H.Venus/H.Earth works quite well.  I believe that this is what is being referred to by the "lone star" on page 1 of TTTA.  I've mapped out a forecast using this cycle, but without the inversions.  

3 rev of H.Earth/H.Mars works pretty well too, although there are areas that need refinement.


H.Mars/H.Jupiter doesn't work that well.  There are certain aspects that have tubes that connect across, but it is not many.  These may be inversions or 'extra pivots' in the other cycles, so it may be worth it to review this one later.  


Also tested 252 rev of G.Moon/G.Sun, marking up the smallest turns I could see on the daily bar timeframe.  To be honest, there are a lot of turns, and it's not clear if they map up or if it is all just noise.  I will need to get intraday data to compare in order to make any conclusions on this one.
