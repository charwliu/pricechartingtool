5 revolutions of H.Venus/H.Earth works extremely well.  
It is dominant in this stock, and I need to work it out for more time backwards, and then solve the inversions.  Then work on price with this cycle.  

On my list to test with this stock is (for larger cycles):
H.Mars 4 revolutions (or possibly 8 revolutions).
H.Mars 1240 degrees (3*360 + 160).
H.Mars 432 degrees.
H.Mars/H.Jupiter 432 degrees.

I did try 44 revolutions of G.Moon, but I think my turns were not picked very well, as I did this without having worked out the H.Venus/H.Mars in that same period.  That was a mistake, and I think I wasted 2 weeks of time by trying for the lunar without having worked out the H.Venus/H.Mars in those same areas.  I am really skeptical about the 44 revolutions of G.Moon.  Could it be possible that this is the length for lunar-based inversions to repeat?  

What I plan to do is work out the 5 rev of H.Venus/H.Earth for all of the history, and then after that, have a look at inversions to make sure they are all in teh same zones throughout.  Some theories I have on inversions is: H.L.Mercury at max or min, then moon marked and then moon 360 degrees from that point?  Or maybe at the H.L.Mercury point, we mark things in H.L. and when H.L. traverses over certain other marked planets, it inverts again?  These are just some guesses.  Direction of H.L.Mercury movement is probably important too.  Some other things to check for a potential repeat of Mercury-based inversions is 15.5 rev. of H.Mercury (approx. 3.73 years).  

So far, with only 1 rev. worked out for the main cycle, it looks like the potential inversion zones are:
H.Venus/H.Earth: 0 deg. to 30 deg.
H.Venus/H.Earth: 300 deg. to (315 or 330) deg.
