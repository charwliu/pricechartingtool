Miscellaneous information from WITS posts:

WITS post #61645, by Owen:
Hi all
Earlier I gave the Solar Fire date for Sydney Exchange as 14 Oct 1997. I think this might be the date some changes at the ASX.   After some more digging I also found the 1 April 1987, 10 am AEST date and believe this to be the correct one.    I also found a date for the All Ords Index (AXO) noted as 2 January 1980 10 am AEST for those that are interested.
Hope this helps!
Owen

Hi Terry
One general source of information on the history of Australia's financial system is Trevor Sykes "Two Centuries of Panic: A History of Corporate Collapses in Australia".  http://www.amazon.com/Two-Centuries-Panic-Corporate-Collapses/dp/0041760131.  From memory it only provides a brief overview of the very early days of share trading but it does provide some good dates later on that might be useful for rectification work.
Unfortunately I don't have my copy at hand or I would have a browse through it for you.
Regards
Wittiam

Hi Folks,
Thank you for all your help. Very much appreciate it.
Sharon I found the history of the a ASX but only gives year and not day  or month, which is very important.
This exercise is also confirming the teaching that is given in a chapter called the Bowery boys in the book published by Wits, called the book of 12.  Gann  also says it is important to get your starting point correct. I believe the ASX has its origins in the Sydney stock exchange and not Melbourne. 
Super Roman gave me links for old newspapers of the Sydney morning Herald and found possibilities like 29/3/1851 and 8/4/1851.
I have also found legal document patient which states that the Sydney stock exchange was registered in Canberra on the 18/12/1851. 
The exchange was originally con ducted in a coffee shop just opposite the old Post office building in George Street. Now going to apply the Bowery boys methodology. 
Thanks to you all 
Regards
 Terry
