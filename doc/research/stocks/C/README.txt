Information and notes for my research on stock C.

rluu_20131022: 
5 rev of H.Venus/H.Earth works well, but not perfect.  If a turn doesn't show up in a repeat, it is usually because it is really delayed.  I don't know why that happens.  Inversions still need to be worked out.

3 rev of H.Earth/H.Mars works on certain sections.  Before 2013-12-03 repeat, it works poorly or sloppy, not having consistent repeats (skips an iteration or so).  But after 2013-12-03 (at 289 deg or so), history shows it repeats kind of well.  

For H.Earth/H.Jupiter, there appears to be repeats, but not very consistently.  It is more likely that it repeats 2 iterations back, than anything else.
So the cycle would be 2 revolutions of H.Earth/H.Jupiter (appoximately 2 years and 2.4 months).  I still need to work this one out further until the current time period and then see how well it runs.
