First Solar, Inc. (NASDAQ: FSLR) is an American manufacturer of thin film photovoltaic (PV) modules, or solar panels, and a provider of PV power plants and supporting services that include finance, construction, maintenance and end-of-life panel recycling. First Solar uses cadmium telluride (CdTe) as a semiconductor to produce panels that are less expensive than those manufactured from crystalline silicon.[2] In 2009, First Solar became the first solar panel manufacturing company to lower its manufacturing cost to $1 per watt[3] (since reduced to 73 cents per watt).[4]

The company was founded in 1990 by inventor Harold McMaster as Solar Cells, Inc. In 1999 it was purchased by True North Partners, LLC, who rebranded it as First Solar, Inc. The company went public in 2006, trading on the NASDAQ. Its current chief executive is James Hughes, who succeeded interim CEO Mike Ahearn on May 3, 2012.[5] First Solar is based in Tempe, Arizona. As of 2010, First Solar was considered the second-largest maker of PV modules worldwide[6] and ranked sixth in Fast Company’s list of the world's 50 most innovative companies.[7] In 2011, it ranked first on Forbes’s list of America’s 25 fastest-growing technology companies.[8]


First Solar manufactures cadmium telluride (CdTe)-based photovoltaic (PV) modules, which produce electricity with a thin CdTe film on glass.[9] In July 2011, the company reached 17.3 percent efficiency, breaking the record set by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL).[10]


In 1984, inventor and entrepreneur Harold McMaster founded Glasstech Solar. McMaster foresaw the opportunity to manufacture low-cost, thin film cells on a large scale. After trying amorphous silicon, he shifted to CdTe at the urging of Jim Nolan and founded Solar Cells, Inc., (SCI) in 1990.[11] In February 1999, McMaster sold the company to True North Partners, an investment arm of the Walton family, owners of Wal-Mart.[12] John T. Walton joined the Board of the new company, and Mike Ahearn of True North became the CEO of the newly minted First Solar. In its early years, First Solar module efficiencies were modest, about 7 percent.

First Solar launched production of commercial products in 2002 and reached an annual production of 25 megawatts (MW) in 2005.[13] At the end of 2009, First Solar had surpassed an annual production rate of one gigawatt (GW)[14] and was the largest PV module manufacturer in the world.[15]

The company is headquartered in Tempe, Arizona and has manufacturing facilities in Perrysburg, Ohio and Kulim, Malaysia.[16] Additionally, First Solar partnered with natural gas provider Enbridge to build the largest PV solar energy farm in the world,[17] located in Sarnia, Ontario, near the U.S.-Canadian border.
