[This article is about] Harold McMaster, who is being recognized for his glass-tempering equipment that is in global use. He died in 2003 at the age of 87 and has more than 100 patents in his name.

One of his companies, Solar Cells Inc., helped form First Solar Inc., of Tempe, Ariz., a firm with $22 billion in market capitalization. First Solar's only North American panel factory is in Perrysburg Township.

1. Experience. First Solar was founded in 1999, but the history of the company goes back decades, according to Dan Myers of Crosslink Capital. Founder Harold McMaster made his first fortune in the late 1940s with Permaglass and later went onto Glasstech. McMaster was one of the world's experts on tempered glass.

In the 80s, McMaster got interested in solar technology and experimented with different ways to put photovoltaic materials on glass. He worked first with silicon and then cadmium-telluride with a company called Solar Cells. Solar Cells had a rough number of years financially but was finally reincarnated as First Solar in 1999.

The company was founded in 1990 by inventor Harold McMaster as Solar Cells, Inc. In 1999 it was purchased by True North Partners, LLC, who rebranded it as First Solar, Inc. The company went public in 2006, trading on the NASDAQ.

In 1984, inventor and entrepreneur Harold McMaster founded Glasstech Solar. McMaster foresaw the opportunity to manufacture low-cost, thin film cells on a large scale. After trying amorphous silicon, he shifted to CdTe at the urging of Jim Nolan and founded Solar Cells, Inc., (SCI) in 1990.



From: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harold_McMaster

Inspired by a vacation in sunny Arizona, McMaster began another company, Glasstech Solar, in 1984, to produce cost-effective solar arrays. His insight was that the essential cost element of large area solar arrays was glass, and he could treat the actual solar cell as simply a different kind of coating on glass. After doing little except absorbing $12 million cash, McMaster gave up on the amorphous silicon research, offered to pay back the 57 investors who followed him into solar cells. He then raised yet another $15 million to create Solar Cells Inc., to work on a different thin-film technology, cadmium telluride. By 1997, Solar Cells had a prototype production machine. In 1995, he brought in a new president, and bought still more stock in the company to fund research, although the company had yet to pay a dividend.[5] According to Ken Zweibel, former head of the Thin Film Partnership program at the Department of Energy's National Renewable Energy Laboratory, SCI was clearly the industry leader in thin-film photovoltaic technology.[5] In 1999, True North Partners, LLC purchased controlling interest, and renamed the company First Solar LLC.

Founded in 1999 as First Solar Holdings, LLC), in Phoenix, Arizona, the company has since taken the nation by storm, expanding production overseas and selling panels in the EU in a marketplace where government subsides promise the largest reward.
