History of the company from the company's website:
http://www.hecla-mining.com/company/company_history.php


Founded by Amasa Campbell, Patsy Clark, and John Finch, Hecla Mining Company is incorporated in the state of Idaho on October 14, 1891.  Over the years, Hecla becomes a leading domestic producer of silver and lead, and, more recently, a major supplier of gold and industrial minerals.  

Hecla Mining Company is incorporated in Washington State on July 12, 1898.  


On July 5, 1900, just as Amasa Campbell had forecast, Hecla pays its first divident of 2 cents per share.  

James F. McCarthy takes over Hecla's daily operations in 1903 and James R. Smith is voted president.  Just 36 years old, McCarthy becomes the heart and soul of Hecla over the next 38 years.  

Hecla transfers its records from the offices of Finch and Campbell in Spokane, Washington, to Wallace, Idaho -- where it would stay for more than 80 years -- on October 14, 1904.  

Frank upman is named president in 1908.

Hecla stock begins trading on the New York Curb Exchange -- later the American Stock Exchange -- on September 23, 1915.  

Fire sweeps through Burke, Idaho on July 13, 1923 -- a Friday -- destroying the Hecla mine buildings, damaging the hoist, and decimating the Burke business district along with 50 homes.  Miraculously, no one is injured: men working underground as far down as the 1600 level are hoisted out of the mine before flames cut off the electricity.  The rest climb hand-over-hand 2,000 feet to the surface.  

The July 13, 1923 Burke fire put Hecla out of commission five months and 18 days; ore is hoisted again on January 27, 1924.  


December 12, 1958, Hecla purchases 184,000 shares in the Lucky Friday Silver-Lead Mines Company, and with an additional acquisition of 644,058 shares becomes the largest shareholder in the Lucky Friday silver-lead mine in Mullan, Idaho.  The mine still operates today. 

A merger between Hecla and Lucky Friday Silver-Lead Mines Company is consummated April 1, 1964.  After 49 years on the American Stock Exchange, Hecla is listed on the prestigious New York Stock Exchange.  

The Hunt brothers' move to corner the silver market in 1979 drives the price to over $50 per ounce.  As a result, Hecla's stock price shoots up from $5.25 in January of 1979 to a high of $53.50 12 months later, making it the year's best performer on the New York Stock Exchange.  The huge upsurge in price enables Hecla to get out of the debt caused by the Lakeshore venture within 18 months.  

On May 9, 1986, the day of the dedication of Hecla's new headquarters, Arthur Brown is named president and chief operating officer.  He takes over the reins of the company as chairman and chief executive officer three weeks later, upon Bill Griffith's retirement.
