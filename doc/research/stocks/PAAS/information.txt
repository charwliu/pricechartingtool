Pan American Silver is the continuing corporation of Pan American Energy Corporation, which was incorporated under the Company Act (British Columbia) on March 7, 1979.  The Company underwent two name changes: in September 1984 to Pan American Minerals Corp., and finally in April 1995 the Company was renamed Pan American Silver Corp.  

Pan American Silver was founded in April 1994 by Ross Beaty and John Wright, after Equinox Resources, which had been founded and built with a successful gold mining company by Mr. Beaty, was taken over by a well-known U.S. mining company.  Mr. Beaty realized that hte fundamentals of the silver market warranted an increase in the long-term price of silver and that there were few well-valued and well-structured stocks available to investors interested in gaining exposure to silver.

March 7, 1979    (Parent company: Pan American Energy Corporation)

Today, after 15 years of consecutive production and financial growth, Pan American is the second-largest primary silver mining company in the world, with seven operating silver mines in Peru, Mexico, Argentina and Bolivia. The Company also owns the Navidad silver deposit, one of the largest undeveloped silver deposits in the world and is the operator of the La Preciosa silver project.

Pan American's mission is to be the largest low-cost primary silver mining company worldwide. Our growth strategy is based on the continued increase of low-cost silver production through the efficient operation and expansion of our existing mines, an aggressive exploration program to replace the silver ounces mined each year and the increase of our silver Reserves and Resources, and the acquisition and development of new silver-rich deposits.
