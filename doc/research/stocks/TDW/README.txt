Information and notes for my research on stock TDW.
##############################################################################

rluu_20130318: The file "H.Venus_H.Mars_1080_deg_repeats.ods" was originally created from the turns in "H.Venus_H.Mars_360_deg_repeats.ods".  Then I made some tweaks, and fixed/updated/added a decent number of turns to H.Venus_H.Mars_1080_deg_repeats.ods, so that H.Venus_H.Mars_360_deg_repeats.ods is kind of out of date.  

rluu_20130318: The file "H.Venus_H.Mars_1080_deg_repeats.ods" contains a repeat that works kind of well.  There are some quirks where a turn disappears and then comes back, but overall it is worth keeping an eye on, and perhaps using.  


rluu_20131022: The 3 revolutions of H.Earth/H.Mars (file: H.Earth_H.Mars_1080_deg_or_3_circle_repeats_TDW_1969_to_2016.ods) works so-so.  Inversions have not been figured out yet.  I still need to try out the 5 rev of H.Venus/H.Earth with this stock.  At this point, I'm not sure if I want to continue studying this stock that in depth.  I tried to short it yesterday, and there was no stock available for shorting.  This means that this stock is not very liquid, and may not be the best stock to study/be an expert with.

rluu_20131101: I took a closer look at the 3 revolutions of H.Earth/H.Mars.  Only a few turns (maybe 15 percent?) have turns that can appear to be consistent.  Overall, this isn't a good one to use for TDW.  Regarding H.Venus/H.Earth, I worked that one out and have a forecast for it.  H.Venus/H.Earth looks okay, we'll see how the forecast goes.  (Inversions and orb not figured out yet.)



rluu_20131206:

Tried 360*4 degrees of H.Mars.  Did not work well.  It looks like 360*8 degrees of H.Mars works okay though.


Tried (360*4)-25 degrees of H.Mars.  

Tried (360*4)-21 degrees of H.Mars.  Seems to work okay.  Worth a closer look.
See document: H.Mars_1419_deg_or_3.94167_circle_repeats_TDW_1969_to_2016.ods.
[The best results so far anyways.]


rluu_20131208:
I tried H.Mercury ((21 * 360) + 153) degrees movement.  When trying this, it appears that doubling it might work better.  I need to follow up with a test on double that value (i.e.:   (2 * ((21 * 360) + 153)) degrees movements.)
