Notes:

#######################################

Cycle Hunter 1, pg. 11, talks about U.S. Steel and says that it might be born at 1:15 or 8:30.  (am or pm not given).  I'm not sure if this is referring to the actual natal or perhaps something else.  

[rluu: In WITS post #39059, Joe Schmoe says that 23 deg 24 min is one of US Steel's axis points.  ]


Using a time of 1:15 pm, yields:
Asc.    13 deg 31' Cancer.
MC:     23 deg 22' Pisces.
Vertex:  0 deg 15' Sagittarius

Using a time of 8:30 am, yields:
Asc.    21 deg 06' Aries.
MC:     11 deg 27' Capricorn.
Vertex: 08 deg 58' Libra


[rluu: On further study, in Cycle Hunter 1, I think he is saying 1 deg 15 min and 8 deg 30 min are the sensitive axis points.]

From http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Carnegie
He concluded negotiations on March 2, 1901, and formed the United States Steel Corporation. 

#######################################

From http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Steel_Corporation
J. P. Morgan and the attorney Elbert H. Gary founded U.S. Steel in 1901 (incorporated on February 25) by combining Andrew Carnegie's Carnegie Steel Company with Gary's Federal Steel Company 

#######################################

From: http://www.usske.sk/corpinfo/hist-e.htm
 The parent company The United States Steel Corporation was founded on 25 February 1901 and started operations on April 1 of that year as a holding company. It was based on the vision and experience of businessman and industrialist Andrew Carnegie, financier John P. Morgan and lawyer Elbert H. Gary.

From the W.D. Gann Master Stock Course, (my binder 1 of 2), Chapter 5, page 3:

For example: UNITED STATES STEEL was incorporated February 25, 1901 and trading began on the New York Stock Exchange on March 28, 1901. This is why Steel makes so many important changes in trend in the month of February and March. Steel's seasonal changes in trend, based on the date of incorporation, are as follows: -

February 25th to April 12th equals 45°.
April 27th equals 60 days or 60° from February 25th.
May 28th equals 90° from Feb. 25th.
June 12th equals 135° from Feb. 25th. June 28th equals 120° from Feb. 25th.
July 30th equals 150° from Feb. 25th.
August 30th equals 180° from Feb. 25th.
October 30th equals 240° from Feb. 25th.
October 14th equals 225° from February 25th.
November 29th equals 270° from Feb. 25th.
December 28th equals 300° from Feb. 25th.
January 11th equals 315° from Feb. 25th.
January 27th equals 330° from Feb. 25th.
February 25th equals 360° or 365 days from Feb. 25th.

By checking over the dates when United States Steel has made minor and major tops and bottoms, you can see how often they have come out very closely to these dates for seasonal changes in trend.

[Twenty pages of text then follow, in which Gann analyzes the US Steel price performance, including its highs and lows, from 1901 to 1935.]

reading a history of JP Morgan and *Carnegie one can narrow down to
about a month to a month and a half target time period for focusing on
the rectification of the steel natal.
I dug up a document in the U.T. Library that MAY shed some light
..................
Morgan sent his lackey to Carnegie to ask him how much he wanted for his
company.........Carnegie writes it down on a piece of paper and the
lackey(Gates) takes it back to Morgan's club. Morgan looks at the
figure written on the paper for about 2 seconds and says "Done" or "I
accept"........that was in mid/late dec 1900........obviously the
lawyers weren't present and there was "some" further negotiation but
some time between mid late dec 1900 and the jensen incorporation date
exists a date where the deal was officially sealed............

"12" will provide the methodology for ascertaining the correct date in
this time period.
i have not rectified this natal. One thing to keep in mind is that
solar arcs and /or diurnals "SHOULD" confirm whatever date the diligent
researcher is able to rectify via the "12" method.
Others may feel differently. I welcome all discussion on this topic cuz
I'm far from the last word on the matter.

the above is the result of several years of google/world cat
searching..........numerous phone conversations with research/reference
librarians..........untold $ in gas, mileage, plane tickets to distant
cites libraries.....etc,etc............there you go........for $50.00
wits membership you just got the harvest of several years of several
people's $ and labor...........

8'deg 24 min 1deg 12 min..................rectify till your
eyeballs fall out.............If you feel like you've been cheated in
WITS, join one of those other groups full of malcontents and cry
yourself a river............


all the best,
Tommy Lewis

Interestingly McWhirter uses Februrary 23, 1901 in New Jersey....not Februrary 25th....as Jensen does.....and she puts the Moon at 4 degrees Taurus.....
 
Using this Moon position,,,,it duplicates all of her other planetary positions and places time @ 6:18 am on that day.
 
She gives special attention to U.S. Steel. and this natal should be considered.
 
Best Regards,

Some further Steel musings (some of which I think I have previously commented on):

 

The rationale for Jensen using the Trenton, NJ, as the locale for Steel’s natal has often perplexed me (notwithstanding his wonderful little Moon at “40 Gemini” radix chart typo).  I know that Steel has a works a few miles away in Fairless Hill, Pa.  His choice of Trenton could be seen as being consistent with his view that the natal should be the locality where an organization is based.  However, I thought that Steel has always been headquartered in Pittsburgh, Pa…

 

“Under the name of United States Steel Corporation, the “billion-dollar steel combine” which J.P. Morgan and his associates have for some time been perfecting, was formally launched yesterday when the articles of association were filed in Jersey City with the County Clerk of Hudson County.” (“Giant Steel Trust Launched at Last”, The New York Times, 26 February 1901, p.3. Emphasis added.)

This Feb 25, 1901 incorporation date accords with Jensen’s date, but not his location.  However, it does match McWhirter’s location (New Jersey), but not her date.

 

Gann also used Feb 25, 1901 in his various writings that comprise the Master Stock Course (p.144, p.160, and p.188).

 

For those interested in first trade dates: Gann also cited Steel’s first date of NYSE trading as March 28, 1901 (p.160 and p.188). This accords with NYT newspaper articles of the day, which isn’t anything that we don’t already know.  However, some might be surprised to learn that the first public trading of Steel actually occurred in the informal open-air “curb” (or “outside”) market on Feb. 26, 1901 – the day after the reported Jersey City incorporation (“Outside Securities”, The New York Times, 27 February 1901, p.13.).
