Steps:

1) Burning Desire that becomes an obsession.

2) Adopt a Definite Purpose (i.e. goal).  Definiteness Of Purpose
takes on animation, life, and power when backed by Burning Desire.

3) Planning definite ways and means to acquire the desire.

4) Every person who wins in any undertaking must be willing to burn his
ships and cut of all sources of retreat.  Only by so doing can one be
sure of maintaining that state of mind known as a burning desire to
win, essential to success.

(Burn all bridges behind, and stake the ENTIRE FUTURE on the ability
to obtain the desire.)

5) Backing the plan with persistence which does not recognize failure.
This is the determination to stand by that desire until it is realized.

6) Believe in the power of Desire backed by Faith.


Faith
Desire
Specialized Knowledge
Imagination (plan, visualization)

Six Steps for transmuting Desire to it's material manifestation:

1) Fix in your mind the exact amount of money you desire.  It is not
sufficient merely to say "I want plenty of money."  Be definite as to
the amount (there is a psychological reason why).

2) Determine exactly what you intend to give in return for the money
you desire.  (There is no such reality as 'something for nothing'.)

3) Establish a definite date when ou intend to posses the money you desire.

4) Create a definite plan for carrying out your desire, and begin at
once, whether you are ready or not, to put this plan into action.

5) Write out a clear, concise statement of the amount of money you
intend to acquire, name the time limit for its acuisition, state what
you intend to give in return for the money, and describe clearly the
plan through which you intend to accumulate it.

6) Read your written statement aloud, twice daily, once just before
retiring at night, and once after arising in teh morning.  As you read
the statement, see and feel and believe yourself already in possession
of the money.

Side todos: 

- Align my thinking with those who also were dreams that made it big.

- Transmute my strongest emotions into dreams of a constructive nature.

- Put into the subconscious mind via autosuggestion, only positive emotions.

- Repeat the Emil Coue formula:
   "Day by day, in every way, I am getting better and better"

Points:

- Every failure brings with it the seed of an equivalent success.

- Every adversity brings with it the seed of an equivalent advantage.

- Opportunity often comes in a different form than expected.
  Sometimes it comes disguised in the form of misfortune, or temporary
  defeat.

- Success comes to those who become success conscious.  Failure comes
  to those who indifferently allow themselves to become failure
  conscious.

Chapter 2: Desire

- Desire is the magnetizing force.

- Dreams are the seedlings of reality.

- Nothing is impossible.  

- Our only limitations are those we set up in our own minds.

Chapter 3: Faith

- Any impulse of thought which is repeatedly passed on to the
  subconscious mind is, finally, accepted and acted upon by the
  subconscious mind, which proceeds to translate that impulse into its
  physical equivalent, by the most practical procedure available.

- All thoughts which have been emotionalized (given feeling) and mixed
  with faith, begin immediately to translate themselves into their
  physical equivalent or counterpart.

- Emotion/feeling is the factor that gives thoughts vitality, life and action.

- The subconscious mind will translate into its physical equivalent, a
  thought impulse of a negative or destructive nature, just as readily
  as it will act upon thought impulses of a positive or constructive
  nature.  

- One can decieve the subconscious mind when giving it instructions
  via autosuggestion.  By this method, conduct yourself just as you
  would, if you were already in possession of hte material thing which
  you are demanding, which you call upon your subconscious mind.

- A mind dominated by positive emotions, becomes a favorable abode for
  the state of mind known as faith.  A mind so dominated may, at will,
  give the subconscious mind instructions, which it will accept and
  act upon immediately.  Faith is a state of mind which may be induced
  by autosuggestion.

- Faith is the 'eternal elixir' which gives life, power, and action
  to the impulse of thought.

- Faith is the basis of all 'micracles'.

- Faith is the element, the 'chemical' which, when mixed with prayer,
  gives one direct communication with Infinite Intelligence.

- Every man is what he is, because of the dominating thoughts which he
  permits to occupy his mind.

Chapter 4: Auto-suggestion

- Emotion/feeling is essential to auto-suggestion.

Chapter 5: Specialized knowledge

- Knowledge will not attract money unless it is organized and
  intelligently directed, through practical plans of action, to the
  definite end of accumulation of money.

- Real meaning of the word 'educate'.  'Educate' is derived from the
  latin word 'educo', meaning to educe, to draw out, to Develop From
  Within.

- Any man is educated who knows where to get knowledge when he needs
  it, and how to organize that knowledge into definite plans of
  action.  Through the assistance of his 'Master Mind' group, Henry
  Ford had at his command all the specialed knowldge he needed to
  enable him to become one of the wealthiest men in America.  It was
  not essential that he have this knowledge in his own mind.

- The accumulation of great fortunes calls for POWER, and power is
  acquired thorugh highly organized and intelligently directed
  specialized knowledge, but that knowledge does not, necessarily,
  have to be in the possession of hte man who accumulates the
  fortune.

- Sources of knowledge:
  - One's own experience and education
  - Experience and education availbale through cooperation of others
      (Master mind Alliance)
  - Colleges and Universities.
  - Public libraries.  Internet.
  - Special training courses.  

- As knowledge is acquired, it must be organized and put into use,
  for a definite purpose, through practical plans.  Knowledge has no
  value except that which can be gained from its application toward some
  worthy end.

- If you contemplate taking additional schooling, first determine
   the purpose for which you want the knowledge you are seeking, then
   learn where this particular sort of knowledge can be obtained,
   from reliable sources.

- Both success and failure are largely the results of habit.  

- Truly there is something to the idea that hero-worship is helpful,
  provided one worships a Winner.

- ***Close association with one who refuses to compromise with
  circumstances he does not like, is an asset that can never be
  measured in terms of money.

Chapter 6: Imagination

- The impulse of Desire is given shape, form and Action through the
  aid of the imaginative faculty of the mind.

- Two forms of imagination:

   - Synthetic imagination: Arrangement of old concepts, ideas or
     plans ito new combinations.

   - Creative imagination: Using direct communications with Inifinite
     Intelligence.  It is the faculty thorugh which 'unches' and
     'inspiration' are received.

- Use the imagination to create a plan for transforming the desire to
  it's material manifestation.  Then reduce the plan to writing.  By doing
  that, you have definitively have given concrete form to the
  intangible desire.

- When there's a will, there's a way.

- The story of practically every great fortune starts with the day
  when a creator of ideas and a seller of ideas got together and
  worked in harmony.

   - Carnegie surrounded himself with men who could do all that he
     could not do.  Men who created ideas, and men who put ideas into
     operation.
