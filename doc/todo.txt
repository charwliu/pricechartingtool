Outstanding things to work on going forward:

CHECK  - Need to ensure selection of artifacts and deletion of them 
CHECK     works properly
CHECK      - Dirty flag needs to be set if artifacts are deleted.
CHECK  - Need to implement selection of pricebars so that they get
CHECK     highlighted and the QLabels at the top get updated with the
CHECK     pricebar.

CHECK  - In pricebarchart.py, need to make sure when I create new
CHECK    QGraphicsItems as either PriceBars or Artifacts, that the
CHECK    QGrahpicsItem flags get set according to whatever tool mode I'm
CHECK    currently in!

  - Turn the __main__() functions into a list of calls to testXXXXX()
    functions... one for each of the classes being tested.

  - Finish testing PriceBarEditWidget() and PriceBarEditDialog().

  - Need to add right-click context menus and popup info/edit dialog widgets.
     - Dialog widgets for info/editing of artifacts should be in new file: 
       pricebarchart_dialogs.py
     - Edit/Dialog widgets for info/editing of Timestamps and PriceBars 
       should go in widgets.py

CHECK  - Remove bolding option of PriceBars (and pen width of it, etc.).

  - Need to create icons for the different new modes for creating indicators.
     - BarCount
     - etc.

  - Need to implement 'snap' functionality, for snapping to a whole bar, 
    bottom/top of a bar, or to the closest integer X (day) for 
    charting the astro chart.

  - Need to implement the spreadsheet widget.

  Indicators:
  - Need to implement indicator for static octaves (in time).
  - Need to implement indicator (moving lines) for dynamic Octive (interval) ratio measurements as the planets move.
  - Need to implement indicator (moving) lines for aspect strength 
    (shad bala and ashtakavarga).
  
  - Need to implement 'Octave' (time) measurements.
  - Need to implement 'Octive' (price) measurements.
