Outstanding things to work on going forward:

  - Need to ensure selection of artifacts and deletion of them works properly
      - Dirty flag needs to be set if artifacts are deleted.
  - Need to implement selection of pricebars so that they get
    highlighted and the QLabels at the top get updated with the
    pricebar.

  - Need to implement 'snap' functionality, for snapping to a whole bar, 
    bottom/top of a bar, or to the closest integer X (day) for 
    charting the astro chart.

  - Need to implement the spreadsheet widget.

  Indicators:
  - Need to implement indicator (moving lines) for dynamic Octive (interval) ratio measurements as the planets move.
  - Need to implement indicator (moving) lines for aspect strength 
    (shad bala and ashtakavarga).
  
  - Need to implement 'Octave' (time) measurements.
  - Need to implement 'Octive' (price) measurements.

  - Need to implement traditional astro charts.
  - Need to implement vedic astro charts.
