Outstanding things to work on going forward:

DONE  - Need to ensure selection of artifacts and deletion of them 
DONE     works properly
DONE      - Dirty flag needs to be set if artifacts are deleted.
DONE  - Need to implement selection of pricebars so that they get
DONE     highlighted and the QLabels at the top get updated with the
DONE     pricebar.
DONE  - In pricebarchart.py, need to make sure when I create new
DONE    QGraphicsItems as either PriceBars or Artifacts, that the
DONE    QGrahpicsItem flags get set according to whatever tool mode I'm
DONE    currently in!
DONE  - Finish testing PriceBarEditWidget() and PriceBarEditDialog().
DONE  - Remove bolding option of PriceBars (and pen width of it, etc.).
DONE  - Need to add right-click context menus and popup info/edit 
DONE    dialog widgets.
DONE     - Add these functions to the pricebargraphicsitem:
DONE           handleSetAstro1(datetime)
DONE           handleSetAstro2(datetime)
DONE           handleSetAstro3(datetime)
DONE     - Add these functions to the base-class artifact:
DONE           handleSetAstro1(datetime)
DONE           handleSetAstro2(datetime)
DONE           handleSetAstro3(datetime)
DONE     - Each GraphicsItem type should have a function called:
DONE           createContextMenu(readOnlyMode=true)
DONE       and any supporting functions that are slots that are connected
DONE       to the actions returned in the QMenu (some of the below may or
DONE       may not apply to the particular graphicsitem):
DONE
DONE           handleSelect()
DONE           handleUnselect()
DONE           handleRemoveItem()
DONE           handleInfoEdit()
DONE           handleInfoShow()
DONE	   
DONE	   handleSetAstro1() (to overwrite and call the base-class
DONE	                      function with the appropriate arguments)
DONE	   handleSetAstro2() (to overwrite and call the base-class
DONE	                      function with the appropriate arguments)
DONE	   handleSetAstro3() (to overwrite and call the base-class
DONE	                      function with the appropriate arguments)
DONE           etc.
DONE
DONE
DONE     - Dialog widgets for info/editing of artifacts should be in new file: 
DONE       pricebarchart_dialogs.py

  - In the astrologychart.SiderealRadixGraphicsItem, clean up the
    code.  Parameterize the pen/brush so that it has foreground color
    for things, background for things and so that the
    alpha/transparency is implemented so that I can overlap sq-of-9
    and other charts on top of it.

  - Add other QGraphicsItems and functionality for the astrology chart.

  - Need to create icons for the different new modes for creating indicators.
     - BarCount
     - etc.

  - Need to implement 'snap' functionality, for snapping to a whole bar, 
    bottom/top of a bar, or to the closest integer X (day) for 
    charting the astro chart.

  - Turn the __main__() functions in each source file into a list of
    calls to testXXXXX() functions... one for each of the classes
    being tested.  Maybe these testXXXXX() functions should be moved
    to a test component?

  Indicators:
  - Need to implement indicator for static octaves (in time).
  - Need to implement indicator (moving lines) for dynamic Octive (interval) ratio measurements as the planets move.
  - Need to implement indicator (moving) lines for aspect strength 
    (shad bala and ashtakavarga).
  
  - Need to implement 'Octave' (time) measurements.
  - Need to implement 'Octave' (price) measurements.

  - Need to implement the following:
     - traditional circle astro charts.
     - vedic astro charts.
     - square of 9 and other number charts.
     - spreadsheet widget (chart).

     - Things to think about:

       - How can I implement the above graphical charts so that I can
         do overlays on each other.  For example, the traditional
         circle astro chart overlapping the square of 9 on a
         QGraphicsScene.  That way I can do a transform on one
         (rotation) to anchor or align one with the other.
