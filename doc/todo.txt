Outstanding things to work on going forward:

  - Set sensible defaults for TimeMeasurementTool (which text to have
    displayed by default).

  - Add a menu in QMainWindow for various actions (Menu called 'Astro
    Actions' or 'Miscellaneous Actions'?).

    Options to add are (may need to organize this better):

      - Enable/disabling of mouse-pointer-position to astro chart 1
        for the current PriceChartDocument.

      - Enable/disabling of mouse-pointer-position to astro chart 2
        for the current PriceChartDocument.

      - Enable/disabling of mouse-pointer-position to astro chart 3
        for the current PriceChartDocument.

      - Opening JHora (no arguments, so the current time).
        This calls some function in MainWindow to do the work (with
        no args for the birthTime and birthLoction).

      - Open JHora with the current PriceChartDocument's birth time/location.
        This calls the current document's launchJHora() function with
        the document's birthInfo and birth timestamp.  launchJHora()
        will do the necessary signal emits to eventually call
        MainWindow's launching function for JHora.

      - Open JHora with the current PriceChartDocument's location/timezone, but
        at the current moment in time (now).

      - Set the current PriceChartDocument's birth time/location in
        its astro chart 1.

      - Set the current moment in time (now) in the current
        PriceChartDocument's astro chart 1 with the
        PriceChartDocument's location/timezone.

      - Set the current PriceChartDocument's birth time/location in
        its astro chart 2.

      - Set the current moment in time (now) in the current
        PriceChartDocument's astro chart 2 with the
        PriceChartDocument's location/timezone.

      - Set the current PriceChartDocument's birth time/location in
        its astro chart 3.

      - Set the current moment in time (now) in the current
        PriceChartDocument's astro chart 3 with the
        PriceChartDocument's location/timezone.


  - Need to add the following time measurements to the time measurement tool:

         DONE- Measurement in units of the ruling periods for all the
         DONE  planets according to the vedic system.  (e.g. ayana,
         DONE  muhurta, etc.)

         - Later: Measurement in units of the kinds of moon/month measurements:

             From wikipedia: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synodic_month

             Month type 	Length in days
             anomalistic 	27.554549878 − 0.000000010390 × Y
             sidereal     	27.321661547 + 0.000000001857 × Y
             tropical     	27.321582241 + 0.000000001506 × Y
             draconic     	27.212220817 + 0.000000003833 × Y
             synodic     	29.530588853 + 0.000000002162 × Y

             - anomalistic month: moon's orbital period measured from 
                 perigee to perigee.
             - sidereal month: moon return to same sidereal longitude
             - tropical month: moon return to same tropical longitude
             - draconic month: moon return to node.
             - synodic month: moon conjunction with sun to conjunction again.

         - Later: Measurements of solar years:
             - Julian solar year: 365.25 days of 86400 SI seconds each.
             - Gregorian calendar year: 365.2425 mean solar days
             - Vernal equinox year: 365.2424 days
             - tropical solar year: 365.24219 days  (this is the mean time)
             - sidereal solar year: 365.256363004 days (this is the mean time) 
	     - anomalistic solar year (time for earth to make a 
               revolution around its apsides): 365.259636 days 
               (this is the mean time.)
             - draconic year: time for the Sun (as seen from Earth) to
               complete one revolution with respect to the same lunar
               node): 346.620075883 days (this is the mean time).
             - lunar year: 12 full cycles of phases of the moon as
               seen from Earth: Approx. 354.37 days.
	       

         - Later: Measurement of all the planetary (heliocentric) 
                     synodic cycles.
         - Later: Measurement of all the planetary (geocentric) cycles.

  - Add the vedic month (what nakshatra the full moon is in) on the
    astro charts.

  - Add panchanga fields and the rulers onto the astro charts.

  - Octave fan (which is a more general Gann fan).
     - Defined by origin and other 2 points.
     - Uses scaling.
     - Order is reversable, and has capability to be modal (shifting).

  - Fibonnaci fan
     - Defined by origin and other 2 points.
     - Uses scaling.
     - Order is reversable

  - Add a right-click option to all the items to copy the following
    (as separate options, and as applicable) to the copy-and-paste
    clipboard:

        - Just the price as a string
        - Just the timestamp as a string
        - Both the price and timestamp, as a string of two lines.

  - Add a right-click option to all the items to open a timestamp in JHora. 
     - Substeps:
         - Create a .jhd file somewhere, maybe in /tmp/ ?  
           Or maybe in ramdisk or in memory?
         - System call to JHora on that above file.

  - Add square root price modal scale.  (vertical bar) This is high
    and low price square rooted, and the musical scale from that, and
    then squared again to get the price.

  - Add square root time modal scale.  (horizontal bar) This is
    earlier timestamp square rooted, to the later timestamp square
    rooted. and the musical scale is created from that, and then
    squared again to get the timestamp.

  - Add code to re-read the CSV data file for new bars.  This is
    initiated upon loading the .pcd file and upon a button press
    somewhere (toolbar and on the menu?).

  - Other time intervals that I may want to explore and check out
    (from Jyotish knowledge):

     - Length of time for hora lagna (2 times lagna)?
     - Length of time for ghati lagna (5 times lagna)?
     - Upgraha:
         - Kaala
         - Mrityu
         - Gulika
         - Mandi

      - Note that a trading day in stocks is from 9:30 am to 4:00 pm. 
        What are the holidays?  How many trading days a year?

        What about for commodities?
        What are the hours per day, and where do they fall?, etc.
        How many holidays?  How many trading days a year?

        - Remember horas have lords.  
          There is Hora (Satya), and Mahaakaala Hora. --> See JHora options.

  - Pi spiral
  - Fibonnaci spiral
  - Spiral based on doubling (cubing?).

  - Circles based on price and sqrt time.
  - Circles based on sqrt price and unit time.
  - Circles based on sqrt price and sqrt time.

  - Concentric circles at fibonnaci intervals (based on scaling).
  - Concentric circles based on doubling (cubing?).

  - Add to the ratio-scripts some of the special numbers from:
       http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_numbers
  
       Specifically, pay attention to the:
         - Irrational and suspected irrational numbers
         - Hypercomplex numbers

  - Ruler for Vimsottari dasa (draggable ends and middle).
      - Dialog to edit start and end datetime.
      - Option to modify lifespan (i.e. timerange).

  - Ruler for all the other dasas like dwi saptati sama dasa
      (draggable ends and middle).

      - Dialog to edit start and end datetime.
      - Option to modify lifespan (i.e. timerange).

  - Modal charts (implement later?):
      Chart with pricebars in Trading Days (TDs).
      Chart with pricebars in Calendar Days (CDs).

  - Narayana Dasa  --> How to implement this?

  - Should snap be added also to when the user tries to drag
    endpoints of various measurement widgets?  --> probably not.

  - In the astrologychart.SiderealRadixGraphicsItem, clean up the
    code.  Parameterize the pen/brush so that it has foreground color
    for things, background for things and so that the
    alpha/transparency is implemented so that I can overlap sq-of-9
    and other charts on top of it.

  - Add other QGraphicsItems and functionality for the astrology chart.

  - Need to create icons for the different new modes for creating indicators.
     - BarCount
     - etc.

  - Need to implement 'snap' functionality, for snapping to a whole bar, 
    bottom/top of a bar, or to the closest integer X (day) for 
    charting the astro chart.

  - Turn the __main__() functions in each source file into a list of
    calls to testXXXXX() functions... one for each of the classes
    being tested.  Maybe these testXXXXX() functions should be moved
    to a test component?

  Indicators:
  - Need to implement indicator for static octaves (in time).

  - Need to implement indicator (moving lines) for dynamic Octive (interval) ratio measurements as the planets move.
  - Need to implement indicator (moving) lines for aspect strength 
    (shad bala and ashtakavarga).

  - Need to implement the following:
     - traditional circle astro charts.
        - May need zoom for this.
     - vedic astro charts.
     - square of 9 and other number charts.
        - May need zoom for this.
     - spreadsheet widget (chart).

     - Things to think about:

       - How can I implement the above graphical charts so that I can
         do overlays on each other.  For example, the traditional
         circle astro chart overlapping the square of 9 on a
         QGraphicsScene.  That way I can do a transform on one
         (rotation) to anchor or align one with the other.

         May need zoom for this.
