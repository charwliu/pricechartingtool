Outstanding things to work on going forward:

TODO:  

  - PriceChartDocumentScripts changes:

    - Add longitude traversal amounts of a certain planet.  Can
      specify parameter for whether it is geocentric, heliocentric,
      etc., and also sidereal/tropical.  Also start time is a
      parameter, and traversal degree increment amount is a parameter too.
      
    - Plot line segments for elongation-degree-distances-between-two-planets.
      
    - Plot line segments that represent difference in longitude between planet X
      and planet Y.  Make sure to account for straddling 0 Aries.
    - Plot vertical lines for the above at turning points from
      increasing to decreasing or decreasing to increasing.
  
    - Plot line segments that represent difference in latitude between planet X
      and planet Y.  
    - Plot vertical lines for the above at turning points from
      increasing to decreasing or decreasing to increasing.

    - Plot line segments that represent difference in declination
      between planet X and planet Y.
    - Plot vertical lines for the above at turning points from
      increasing to decreasing or decreasing to increasing.

    - Consider adding orb functionality for
      longitude-aspect-between-two-planets.  Gradiants would be drawn
      on the chart for this feature.

  - Fix MOF, COE, etc. to be calculated properly.

  - Widget/area (kinda like a spreadsheet but with filterable choices
    for selections) to step through certain timestamps in a chart so
    that it is focused on in the pricebarchart and so that it is
    displayed in the astrology chart.  All that the user has to do is
    click the down or up arrow, or highlight the entry in the list.
    The list has a column for the tag name, a column for the
    timestamp, and a column for the tag str.  This feature will make
    it much easier to find aspect cycles and sensitive points in the
    markets.  Declinations and parallel/contraparallels would still be
    difficult to see.

      Timestamps include:

        - Tagged pricebars as highs and lows (nonempty, certain tag:
          H, HH, HHH, etc.)

        - Artifact type (nonempty, certain tag).  Usually this will
          just be the vertical line.

    Maybe it makes sense to have some kind of 'processing' feature
    where planet hits at highs and lows are drawn on an astrology
    chart as an X at a color that is somewhat transparent, and if
    there are more X's at a location, then the color sum of the hit is
    displayed, so that if there are many hits to a degree, the drawn
    area would be much darker than X's in less frequently hit areas.

  - Add to ephemeris, functions to get HoraLagna, GhatiLagna,
    MeanSouthNode, TrueSouthNode.  Then fix the TODO's for HoraLagna,
    GhatiLagna, MeanSouthNode, TrueSouthNode.

  - Change display of longitude degrees in the astrology chart to use
    the longitude degree [0, 30) and the astro sign format.

  - Think about ways to improve the performance of calculating/drawing
    the astrology chart aspects.

  - Add to measurement-type artifact graphics items a function that
    will return the distance in scaled units.  When this is done, then
    add functionality to the top of the document widget (the area
    where high/low/open/close, current timestamp, etc. is) that will
    print the ratio between the two measurements, in both directions.
    So if one line has length 6 and the other has length 9, then we
    would see:

           1:1.5 and 1:0.666
        or 1.5 and 0.666

           and 

           6:9 and 9:6

  - Improve getStockDataFromGoogle.py so that the user doesn't have to
    manually split up the queries into 15-year chunks, as is the case
    now.  Note: getStockDataFromYahoo.py works as we would like, so
    fixing getStockDataFromGoogle.py is not needed for now.
    
  - Consider adding the following time measurements to the time
    measurement tool:

         - Later: Measurement in units of the kinds of moon/month measurements:

             From wikipedia: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synodic_month

             Month type 	Length in days
             anomalistic 	27.554549878 − 0.000000010390 × Y
             sidereal     	27.321661547 + 0.000000001857 × Y
             tropical     	27.321582241 + 0.000000001506 × Y
             draconic     	27.212220817 + 0.000000003833 × Y
             synodic     	29.530588853 + 0.000000002162 × Y

             - anomalistic month: moon's orbital period measured from 
                 perigee to perigee.
             - sidereal month: moon return to same sidereal longitude
             - tropical month: moon return to same tropical longitude
             - draconic month: moon return to node.
             - synodic month: moon conjunction with sun to conjunction again.

         - Later: Measurements of solar years:
             - Julian solar year: 365.25 days of 86400 SI seconds each.
             - Gregorian calendar year: 365.2425 mean solar days
             - Vernal equinox year: 365.2424 days
             - tropical solar year: 365.24219 days  (this is the mean time)
             - sidereal solar year: 365.256363004 days (this is the mean time) 
	     - anomalistic solar year (time for earth to make a 
               revolution around its apsides): 365.259636 days 
               (this is the mean time.)
             - draconic year: time for the Sun (as seen from Earth) to
               complete one revolution with respect to the same lunar
               node): 346.620075883 days (this is the mean time).
             - lunar year: 12 full cycles of phases of the moon as
               seen from Earth: Approx. 354.37 days.
	       

         - Later: Measurement of all the planetary (heliocentric) 
                     synodic cycles.
         - Later: Measurement of all the planetary (geocentric) cycles.

  - Dasa measurement tools:
      - Should I add an option to modify dasa lifespan (i.e. timerange)?

  - Add the vedic month (what nakshatra the full moon is in) on the
    astro charts.

  - Add panchanga fields and the rulers onto the astro charts.

  - Add a right-click option to all the items to copy the following
    (as separate options, and as applicable) to the copy-and-paste
    clipboard:

        - Just the price as a string
        - Just the timestamp as a string
        - Both the price and timestamp, as a string of two lines.

  - Add square root price modal scale.  (vertical bar) This is high
    and low price square rooted, and the musical scale from that, and
    then squared again to get the price.

  - Add square root time modal scale.  (horizontal bar) This is
    earlier timestamp square rooted, to the later timestamp square
    rooted. and the musical scale is created from that, and then
    squared again to get the timestamp.

  - Other time intervals that I may want to explore and check out
    (from Jyotish knowledge):

     - Length of time for hora lagna (2 times lagna)?
     - Length of time for ghati lagna (5 times lagna)?
     - Upgraha:
         - Kaala
         - Mrityu
         - Gulika
         - Mandi

      - Note that a trading day in stocks is from 9:30 am to 4:00 pm. 
        What are the holidays?  How many trading days a year?

        What about for commodities?
        What are the hours per day, and where do they fall?, etc.
        How many holidays?  How many trading days a year?

        - Remember horas have lords.  
          There is Hora (Satya), and Mahaakaala Hora. --> See JHora options.

  - Pi spiral
  - Fibonnaci spiral
  - Spiral based on doubling (cubing?).

  - Circles based on price and sqrt time.
  - Circles based on sqrt price and unit time.
  - Circles based on sqrt price and sqrt time.

  - Concentric circles at fibonnaci intervals (based on scaling).
  - Concentric circles based on doubling (cubing?).

  - Add to the ratio-scripts some of the special numbers from:
       http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_numbers
  
       Specifically, pay attention to the:
         - Irrational and suspected irrational numbers
         - Hypercomplex numbers

  - Modal charts (implement later?):
      Chart with pricebars in Trading Days (TDs).
      Chart with pricebars in Calendar Days (CDs).

  - Narayana Dasa  --> How to implement this?

  - In the astrologychart.SiderealRadixGraphicsItem, clean up the
    code.  Parameterize the pen/brush so that it has foreground color
    for things, background for things and so that the
    alpha/transparency is implemented so that I can overlap sq-of-9
    and other charts on top of it.

  - Add other QGraphicsItems and functionality for the astrology chart.

  - Turn the __main__() functions in each source file into a list of
    calls to testXXXXX() functions... one for each of the classes
    being tested.  Maybe these testXXXXX() functions should be moved
    to a test component?

  Indicators:
  - Need to implement indicator for static octaves (in time).

  - Need to implement indicator (moving lines) for dynamic Octive (interval) ratio measurements as the planets move.
  - Need to implement indicator (moving) lines for aspect strength 
    (shad bala and ashtakavarga).

  - Need to implement the following:
     - vedic astro charts.
     - square of 9 and other number charts.
        - May need zoom for this.
     - spreadsheet widget (chart).

     - Things to think about:

       - How can I implement the above graphical charts so that I can
         do overlays on each other.  For example, the traditional
         circle astro chart overlapping the square of 9 on a
         QGraphicsScene.  That way I can do a transform on one
         (rotation) to anchor or align one with the other.

         May need zoom for this.

##############################################################################

TODO's that are done:

DONE  - Set sensible defaults for TimeMeasurementTool (which text to have
DONE    displayed by default).
DONE
DONE  - Verify that for PriceBarGraphicsItems (PriceBars), that the
DONE    timestamps are correct for each pricebar.  This means it is placed
DONE    correctly in the QGraphicsScene, displayed correctly with the
DONE    mouse cursor location, and also displays correctly, matching the
DONE    timestamp in the astrology chart.
DONE
DONE
DONE- Measurement in units of the ruling periods for all the
DONE  planets according to the vedic system.  (e.g. ayana,
DONE  muhurta, etc.)
DONE
DONE
DONE  - Change the context menu on all artifact graphics items so that
DONE    'Remove' action can be done via 'r' key when the context menu is
DONE    present.
DONE
DONE
DONE  - Add lines for astrology aspects on the astrology chart.  Add to
DONE    app preferences settings for customizing the colors of different
DONE    aspects, and for orbs for each aspect.
DONE
DONE
DONE  - Remove Sun from heliocentric astrology chart.
DONE  - Remove Moon and nodes from heliocentric astrology chart.
DONE  - Remove Earth from geocentric astrology chart.
DONE
DONE  - Add MOF, COE, etc. to astrology chart.
DONE
DONE
DONE  - Fix bug in zoom functionality.  For some reason, when you zoom in
DONE    to a certain resolution, it will 'jump' the center location of the
DONE    screen and cut off QGraphicsItems from being in the scrollable
DONE    area of the view.  It is unknown why it happens this way.
DONE
DONE    ---> Done as much as I could for now.  
DONE         It appearse it is a float value over-flow from the perspective
DONE         of the qgraphicsview's internal variables, which was caused by
DONE         zooming in way too much relative to the scene.  Resolution: I
DONE         shifted the sceneXPos conversion to julian day by a large amount.
DONE
DONE  - Add pricebarchartsettings (preferences) for bar height and bar
DONE    width settings of the timemodalscale and pricemodalscale artifacts.
DONE
DONE  - Fix the bug where the Gann Fan lines would sometimes disappear.
DONE    Currently, it is not known why this happens.
DONE 
DONE    ---> Fixed.  Bug was due to two reasons: 
DONE         1) Bad infinite-line intersection algorithm used.
DONE         2) QRectF.contains() function not matching floats that are 
DONE            on the edge of the rectangle as being contained within 
DONE            the QRect.
DONE   
DONE
DONE  - Add astrology houses to the astrology chart.  Add to the
DONE    PlanetaryInfoTable as well.
DONE
DONE  - Add navamsa and nakshatra pada to the PlanetaryInfoTable.
DONE
DONE  - Add app preferences for which planets to do calculations for and
DONE    which planets to display in each of the astrology charts (and
DONE    planetary info table).
DONE
DONE  - Add QSettings and app settings dialog for enabling or disabling
DONE    (via check boxes) the calculations of various planets (in general)
DONE    or for specific charts such as the astrology chart or the
DONE    planetary info chart.
DONE
DONE    - Do latitude calculations for what I've done with declination in
DONE      PriceChartDocumentScripts.
DONE
DONE    - Add longitude aspect-between-two-planets vertical lines.  
DONE      It should be parameterized so that we have:
DONE    
DONE          - planet1Name
DONE          - planet2Name
DONE          - difference in degrees (approaching and leaving amount)
DONE
