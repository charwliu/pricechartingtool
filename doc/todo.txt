Outstanding things to work on going forward:

DONE
DONE  - Update the Time Measurement tool to include months.
DONE     - Add option to display text of various things.
DONE     - Also include calculation for square root of time elapsed.
DONE
DONE  - Add Price Measurement tool.  
DONE
DONE        - Price difference.
DONE        - Square root of price.
DONE
DONE	- Text scaling.
DONE        - text font
DONE        - text color
DONE	
DONE        
DONE
DONE  - Fibonnaci time retracement (which also implies extension since
DONE    they are the same).  FibTimeRetracementTool.
DONE
DONE
DONE  - Fibonnaci price retracement (which also implies extension since
DONE    they are the same).  FibPriceRetracementTool
DONE
DONE  - Add an option to 'PriceTimeInfo' for a flag for drawing a line to
DONE    the info point.  (in: pricebarchartsettings, artifact, edit
DONE    widget/dialog and graphicsitem).  Also add pricebarchartsettings
DONE    for what measurements/text to display when creating the items 
DONE    by default.
DONE
DONE  - Split the modal-scale-tool to price-modal-scale and time-modal-scale.
DONE    (and change it to restrict the x, y, etc.)
DONE
DONE  - TODO: Lower precision of text of the PTV calculated numbers.
DONE
DONE
DONE - Bug: When loading a pricechartdocument, the PriceTimeVector
DONE   graphics items don't apply the tilted text if the flag is set.  It
DONE   works okay if you add additional PriceTimeVectors though.
DONE
DONE
DONE
DONE
DONE  - PTV (Price-Time-Vector).
DONE        To modify:
DONE          pricebarchart.py 
DONE                - Fix text angle (it uses scaling, but still not perfect).
DONE                - Make sure click-drag for moving the item works.
DONE                  Currently it only draws the text as it moves it.
DONE                - Make sure click-drag for moving start endpoint works.
DONE                - Make sure click-drag for moving end endpoint works.
DONE
DONE - Bug: Need to update the 'closest point' algorithm to use
DONE   scaling so that the actual pricebar point that is closest to the mouse
DONE   (in the view) is the one that is selected, not by the closest in the
DONE   scene.
DONE
DONE
  - Test the scaling calculations and positions of:
         - Price Measurement Tool
         - Time Measurement Tool
         - PriceTimeInfo Tool
         - PriceTimeVector Tool

  - Need to add the following time measurements to the time measurement tool:

         - Measurement in units of the ruling periods for all the
           planets according to the vedic system.  (e.g. ayana,
           muhurta, etc.)

         - Measurement in units of the kinds of moon measurements.

  - Line segment tool.  (when selected, box is drawn around it.  need
    property/setting for the invisible 'width' of the line segment.)

        - Need to add context menu option for extending line to the
          right or left by 2x.

  - Octave fan (which is a more general Gann fan).
     - Defined by origin and other 2 points.
     - Uses scaling.
     - Order is reversable, and has capability to be modal (shifting).

  - Fibonnaci fan
     - Defined by origin and other 2 points.
     - Uses scaling.
     - Order is reversable

  - Add a right-click option to all the items to open a timestamp in JHora. 
     - Substeps:
         - Create a .jhd file somewhere, maybe in /tmp/ ?  
           Or maybe in ramdisk or in memory?
         - System call to JHora on that above file.

  - Use 'snap' enabled flag for ptv tool and line segment tool.

      - Note it is already used for pricetimeinfo tool, but needs to
        be also changeable in other tool modes.  Make sure it doesn't
        get cleared between shifting to different tool modes.

  - Update scalixng class to be able to calculate the following (using scaling):

DONE      - Add to the scaling class, transform scaling values for the
DONE        graphics view, as separate variables from just the regular
DONE        scaling values.

      - Square root of a price (absolute).

      - Square root of a timestamp (elapsed time since birth).  
        With scaling applied.

      - Distance between two points (with scaling applied):
            - Between points: Constant price, varying time.
            - Between points: Constant time, varying price.
            - Between points: Varying price and time.
      - Square root of distance between two points (with scaling applied):
            - Between points: Constant price, varying time.
            - Between points: Constant time, varying price.
            - Between points: Varying price and time.

      - Return the amount of time elapsed since birth (with scaling applied).
      - Return the amount of price change since birth (with scaling applied).

  - For scaling of all the price/time calculations and their square
    roots, need to re-think how it all works (accessing the scaling
    class via the graphics scene), and make sure all calculations are
    correct and consistent.

  - Add square root price modal scale.  (vertical bar) This is high
    and low price square rooted, and the musical scale from that, and
    then squared again to get the price.

  - Add square root time modal scale.  (horizontal bar) This is
    earlier timestamp square rooted, to the later timestamp square
    rooted. and the musical scale is created from that, and then
    squared again to get the timestamp.

  - Add code to re-read the CSV data file for new bars.  This is
    initiated upon loading the .pcd file and upon a button press
    somewhere (toolbar and on the menu?).

  - Pi spiral
  - Fibonnaci spiral
  - Spiral based on doubling (cubing?).

  - Circles based on price and sqrt time.
  - Circles based on sqrt price and unit time.
  - Circles based on sqrt price and sqrt time.

  - Concentric circles at fibonnaci intervals (based on scaling).
  - Concentric circles based on doubling (cubing?).

  - Add to the ratio-scripts some of the special numbers from:
       http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_numbers
  
       Specifically, pay attention to the:
         - Irrational and suspected irrational numbers
         - Hypercomplex numbers

  - Ruler for Vimsottari dasa (draggable ends and middle).
      - Dialog to edit start and end datetime.
      - Option to modify lifespan (i.e. timerange).

  - Ruler for all the other dasas like dwi saptati sama dasa
      (draggable ends and middle).

      - Dialog to edit start and end datetime.
      - Option to modify lifespan (i.e. timerange).

  - Modal charts (implement later?):
      Chart with pricebars in Trading Days (TDs).
      Chart with pricebars in Calendar Days (CDs).

  - Narayana Dasa  --> How to implement this?

  - Should snap be added also to when the user tries to drag
    endpoints of various measurement widgets?  --> probably not.

  - In the astrologychart.SiderealRadixGraphicsItem, clean up the
    code.  Parameterize the pen/brush so that it has foreground color
    for things, background for things and so that the
    alpha/transparency is implemented so that I can overlap sq-of-9
    and other charts on top of it.

  - Add other QGraphicsItems and functionality for the astrology chart.

  - Need to create icons for the different new modes for creating indicators.
     - BarCount
     - etc.

  - Need to implement 'snap' functionality, for snapping to a whole bar, 
    bottom/top of a bar, or to the closest integer X (day) for 
    charting the astro chart.

  - Turn the __main__() functions in each source file into a list of
    calls to testXXXXX() functions... one for each of the classes
    being tested.  Maybe these testXXXXX() functions should be moved
    to a test component?

  Indicators:
  - Need to implement indicator for static octaves (in time).

  - Need to implement indicator (moving lines) for dynamic Octive (interval) ratio measurements as the planets move.
  - Need to implement indicator (moving) lines for aspect strength 
    (shad bala and ashtakavarga).

  - Need to implement the following:
     - traditional circle astro charts.
     - vedic astro charts.
     - square of 9 and other number charts.
     - spreadsheet widget (chart).

     - Things to think about:

       - How can I implement the above graphical charts so that I can
         do overlays on each other.  For example, the traditional
         circle astro chart overlapping the square of 9 on a
         QGraphicsScene.  That way I can do a transform on one
         (rotation) to anchor or align one with the other.
