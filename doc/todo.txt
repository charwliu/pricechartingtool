Outstanding things to work on going forward:

DONE  - Need to ensure selection of artifacts and deletion of them 
DONE     works properly
DONE      - Dirty flag needs to be set if artifacts are deleted.
DONE  - Need to implement selection of pricebars so that they get
DONE     highlighted and the QLabels at the top get updated with the
DONE     pricebar.
DONE  - In pricebarchart.py, need to make sure when I create new
DONE    QGraphicsItems as either PriceBars or Artifacts, that the
DONE    QGrahpicsItem flags get set according to whatever tool mode I'm
DONE    currently in!
DONE  - Finish testing PriceBarEditWidget() and PriceBarEditDialog().
DONE  - Remove bolding option of PriceBars (and pen width of it, etc.).


  - Need to add right-click context menus and popup info/edit dialog widgets.

     - Add these functions to the pricebargraphicsitem:

           handleSetAstro1(datetime)
           handleSetAstro2(datetime)
           handleSetAstro3(datetime)

     - Add these functions to the base-class artifact:

           handleSetAstro1(datetime)
           handleSetAstro2(datetime)
           handleSetAstro3(datetime)

     - Each GraphicsItem type should have a function called:
 
           createContextMenu(readOnlyMode=true)

       and any supporting functions that are slots that are connected
       to the actions returned in the QMenu (some of the below may or
       may not apply to the particular graphicsitem):

           handleSelect()
           handleUnselect()
           handleRemoveItem()
           handleInfoEdit()
           handleInfoShow()
	   
	   handleSetAstro1() (to overwrite and call the base-class
	                      function with the appropriate arguments)
	   handleSetAstro2() (to overwrite and call the base-class
	                      function with the appropriate arguments)
	   handleSetAstro3() (to overwrite and call the base-class
	                      function with the appropriate arguments)
           etc.


     - Dialog widgets for info/editing of artifacts should be in new file: 
       pricebarchart_dialogs.py
     - Edit/Dialog widgets for info/editing of Timestamps and PriceBars 
       should go in widgets.py

  - Need to create icons for the different new modes for creating indicators.
     - BarCount
     - etc.

  - Need to implement 'snap' functionality, for snapping to a whole bar, 
    bottom/top of a bar, or to the closest integer X (day) for 
    charting the astro chart.

  - Need to implement the spreadsheet widget.

  - Turn the __main__() functions in each source file into a list of
    calls to testXXXXX() functions... one for each of the classes
    being tested.  Maybe these testXXXXX() functions should be moved
    to a test component?

  Indicators:
  - Need to implement indicator for static octaves (in time).
  - Need to implement indicator (moving lines) for dynamic Octive (interval) ratio measurements as the planets move.
  - Need to implement indicator (moving) lines for aspect strength 
    (shad bala and ashtakavarga).
  
  - Need to implement 'Octave' (time) measurements.
  - Need to implement 'Octive' (price) measurements.

  - Need to implement traditional astro charts.
  - Need to implement vedic astro charts.
