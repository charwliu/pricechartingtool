File: PriceConversions.ods

Description: Use this spreadsheet as a calculator for conversions between price and angle, and vice versa.  It supports time factors.


rluu_20130913: This is the file to use for study and calculations, for now.

File: convertPriceToAnglesOnCircles.py

Description: rluu_20130913: Python script for converting between price and angles.  I wrote this script a long time ago, and it does not have support for time factors, so for research purposes it has almost no use.  I keep this here because I will want to add time factor capability to it eventually, and then add it to my codebase of PriceChartingTool or to my codebase when I want to do trade automation.

File: AngleIncrements.ods

Description: rluu_20130913: Not sure what I was doing with this file before, but I think it was finding out how many degrees are in each number division of a circle of various sizes.  This file has almost no practical usage value, but kept here just in case because I don't care to explore enough right now.  Eventually I should probably remove this file.
