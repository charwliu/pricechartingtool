Notice:

Qt 4.5.2 and the Qt 4.5.2 license file has been removed from this section
because the source code package is very large.  The person building should
obtain the Open Source edition of Qt.

Any 4.5 version after 4.5.2 should in theory work too but that has not been
tested.  The Qt library developers and maintainers usually do a very good job
maintaining backwards compatibility in future releases.
