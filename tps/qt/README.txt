Notice:

Qt 4.7.4 can be obtained here:
ftp://ftp.trolltech.com/qt/source/qt-everywhere-opensource-src-4.7.4.tar.gz


Any 4.7 version after 4.7.4 should in theory work too but that has not been
tested.  The Qt library developers and maintainers usually do a very good job
maintaining backwards compatibility in future releases.

A listing of all versions released can be obtained from:
